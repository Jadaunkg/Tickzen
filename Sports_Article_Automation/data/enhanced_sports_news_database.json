      "summary": "Telangana has scrapped its two-child norm for local body elections, a rule that previously disqualified individuals with more than two children. Citing a declining fertility rate below the replacement level, the state government argued the decades-old population control measure is no longer relevant. Officials believe maintaining the replacement fertility rate is crucial for the state's future demographic balance, as citizens increasingly opt for smaller families.",
