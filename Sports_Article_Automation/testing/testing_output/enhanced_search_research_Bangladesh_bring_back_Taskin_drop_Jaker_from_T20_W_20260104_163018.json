The biggest talking point has to be the surprising exclusion of **Jaker Ali**. Can you believe it? This guy has been a T20I staple for Bangladesh, featuring in *all 45* T20Is since March 2024. But, sadly, a dip in form and some serious criticism over his predominantly leg-side batting style – which, let’s be honest, hasn’t been delivering the goods lately – has seen him lose his spot, not just here but in other formats too. Tough break, Jaker! On the flip side, we’ve got some stability at the top with **Litton Das** retaining his captaincy – good call! And talk about a comeback: the fiery pacer **Taskin Ahmed** is back in the mix after missing the recent Ireland series. That’s a huge boost for the Tigers! Let’s talk willow power. The top three is looking solid with the in-form **Litton**, along with **Tanzid Hasan** and **Saif Hassan** ready to unleash. For the crucial middle order, we’ll see **Towhid Hridoy**, **Shamim Hossain**, and **Nurul Hasan** stepping up. Keep an eye on **Parvez Hossain Emon** too; he’s been impressing at No. 4 in the ongoing BPL and could definitely snag that spot! But where the Tigers truly roar is their bowling, and this squad really leans into that strength. Taskin’s return fortifies an already impressive pace battery that includes the ‘Fizz’ **Mustafizur Rahman**, the tenacious **Tanzim Hasan**, the left-arm swing of **Shoriful Islam**, and the all-round skills of **Mohammad Saifuddin**. That’s a serious pace attack, folks! And the spinners? They’re looking sharp too! **Rishad Hossain** will be leading the charge, supported by the crafty left-arm spin of **Nasum Ahmed** and the off-spin wizardry of **Mahedi Hasan**, who’s a known specialist in those crucial powerplay overs. Now, here’s a curveball for you! Bangladesh were originally slated to play their first three matches in Kolkata and the last one in Mumbai. BUT, the BCB is actually planning to write to the ICC to request a shift of all their fixtures to Sri Lanka! Why, you ask? Well, it seems Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released Mustafizur from their IPL 2026 squad following instructions from the BCCI. Talk about some behind-the-scenes drama! So there you have it, the full squad ready to make some noise at the T20 World Cup 2026: **Litton Das (capt), Saif Hassan, Tanzid Hasan, Parvez Hossain Emon, Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Nurul Hasan (wk), Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Taskin Ahmed, Mohammad Saifuddin, Shoriful Islam.** What do you guys think of this lineup? Any surprises for you? Let us know in the comments!
