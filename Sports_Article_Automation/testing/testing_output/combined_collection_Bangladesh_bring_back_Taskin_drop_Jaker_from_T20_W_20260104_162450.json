However, he had been out of form and has even lost his place in Bangladesh's sides for the other formats, while also facing extensive criticism for his predominantly leg-side batting style, which has seen diminishing returns.\n\nIn-form batters - Litton, Tanzid Hasan and Saif Hassan - will make up the top three.

The first day of the fifth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground promised fireworks, but instead, we got… well, a whole lot of sky-watching, head-scratching, and eventually, a chorus of boos.\n\nDespite a massive crowd of 49,574 – the biggest for a Test at the SCG since way back in 1975-76 – turning up with high hopes, the weather gods, or perhaps the officials, had other ideas. England managed to chalk up a decent 211 for 3 from 45 overs before umpires Ahsan Raza and Chris Gaffaney took the players off the field. The kicker? This was a full 15 minutes *before* the scheduled tea interval!\n\nWhat followed was a frustrating back-and-forth with Mother Nature and some rather strict protocols. First, lightning strikes in the Sydney area brought play to a halt, then rain showers joined the party. The rules state no play can resume until at least 30 minutes after the last lightning strike, which meant a loooong wait for the final session to even begin.\n\nBut here’s where it got really spicy: play was finally abandoned just after 5 pm local time – a whole half an hour before stumps were meant to be drawn – even though the rain had stopped! Groundstaff, apparently, decided against a clean-up operation because *more* showers were supposedly on their way. The announcement was met with a deafening wave of boos from the patient crowd, only for another quick burst of rain to follow shortly after, almost as if to say, “See? We told ya!”\n\nAnd boy, did that get the pundits talking! Former England captain Michael Vaughan, never one to shy away from an opinion, was fuming on BBC’s Test Match Special. He reckoned we’d “sawn off the public” by “a couple of hours at least.” His main beef? The “mindset” in Test cricket. “In T20 cricket, you play in this,” Vaughan argued. “Test cricket is the one format that we do everything we possibly can to get off the pitch. The other two formats, we do everything we possibly can to get on the pitch. I just don’t understand why we don’t have that same mindset in Test match cricket.”\n\nJason Gillespie, the former Aussie quick, echoed the sentiment, telling ABC Radio that “Our game shoots itself in the foot time and time and time again.”\n\nBut what about the guys in the middle? Harry Brook, who top-scored for England with a brilliant 78 not out, offered a different perspective. He and Joe Root had zero qualms about walking off for bad light. “We could hardly see the ball when I was batting at the end,” Brook admitted. “Me and Rooty just said to [the umpires], ‘It’s so dark out here’. The Aussie boys were saying, ‘Are we going off?’ so everybody was pretty much in the same boat.” He added that they knew rain was coming and had pretty much accepted their fate.\n\nEven Australia’s assistant coach, Daniel Vettori, initially admitted their players were a bit surprised by the abandonment, though he quickly added, “and then it rained again, so we stopped those thoughts.” When pressed on balancing player safety with entertaining the massive crowds, Vettori was classic diplomatic: “As a former player, I dreamed of rain, so I got to be mindful that I don’t change my tune too much.” He acknowledged the desire to play as much as possible but stressed the importance of rules and the unpredictable nature of weather.\n\nSo, there you have it – a day filled with more debate than actual cricket! Let’s hope for better fortunes tomorrow. To make up for the lost time, play will kick off 30 minutes early at 10 am local time on day two. Here’s hoping the skies are clearer and the only thing being cut short is a few Aussie wickets!\n\nSOURCE: 'Keep calm and keep a clear mind' - Gleeson the hero in SA20's first Super Over finish [NEUTRAL] [RECENT] [STANDARD]\nURL: https://www.espn.com.sg/cricket/story/_/id/47479682/sa20-richard-gleeson-super-star-joburg-super-kings-beat-durban-super-giants\nCONTENT: Open Extended Reactions\n\nIn a high-scoring match at a high-scoring ground at a high altitude, nobody wanted the ball more than Richard Gleeson, who stepped up to deliver the first Super Over in SA20 history for Joburg Super Kings (JSK) against Durban's Super Giants (DSG) on Thursday. With scores tied at 205 after 40 overs, the new year's day crowd at the Wanderers enjoyed an unexpected treat as Gleeson conceded only five runs in the Super Over and JSK then surged to victory and to the top of the points table.\n\n\"You don't want easy wins each game. They are great but it's moments like these where you are under pressure and you have to fall back on your skills, which gives you great confidence as a bowler,\" Gleeson said afterwards. \"That's the big bit: trying to execute under pressure. You can practice as much as you want but when you get wet conditions, with the dew and you're under pressure with the crowd, it is difficult. I've got a few techniques that we use with the psychologist and I've done it quite a bit in the past. I just call on that experience to try and keep calm and keep a clear mind.\"\n\nIt was, in fact, the first time Gleeson has bowled a Super Over but he does have plenty of experience and success at the death. In 2022, he delivered the last over for Lancashire against Yorkshire in a Blast game that was tied because he dismissed Harry Brook off the final ball. Overall, since 2022, of bowlers who have delivered more than 400 balls in T20 cricket, Gleeson is the fifth best at the death (overs 17 to 20) in terms of economy rate (8.60) with 47 wickets at 13.82. Bear in mind that Jasprit Bumrah leads this list (6.65) and you have to understand how impressive Gleeson's numbers are.\n\nAt the Wanderers, Gleeson took 3 for 41 in DSG's chase in the regular game, which included bouncing Jos Buttler out for 15, removing Aiden Markram with DSG needing 38 runs off 21 balls, and bowling David Wiese with a yorker in the penultimate over. He was then tasked with the Super Over and could have had a wicket first ball when Evan Jones hit him to long-on but Matthew de Villiers put the chance down. That could easily have put Gleeson off and though he had fleeting thoughts that the dropped catch could cost JSK, he quickly put those aside. \"[I thought], you've just dropped the match,\" Gleeson joked. \"But I backed myself. I knew I was executing and the next ball was the most important.\"\n\nAs he delivered his second ball, Gleeson saw Buttler backing away and banged it in short and wide, away from where Buttler could connect with it well. He followed up with a yorker which Buttler could only squeeze away for one. Jones kept trying to swing big and inside-edged the next ball for one before Gleeson went short again to Buttler. He finished off with a yorker as DSG totalled just five and things had worked out exactly as Gleeson hoped they would.\n\n\"The plans going into the Super Over were really simple: to try and execute the yorkers, try and get them to hit to the longer part of the boundary but not be too predictable,\" he said. \"I knew I had the short ball I could go to, pace off, so I just wanted to try and keep them guessing and have the batter thinking about two deliveries instead of just one.\"\n\nRichard Gleeson claimed key wickets at the death ECB via Getty Images\n\nThat Jones, who had earlier brought DSG back into the match with personal highest SA20 score of 43 off just 17 balls, could not get Gleeson away was testament to the bowler's skills.\n\nJones' strategy during his match-tying innings was simple: \"It's about standing still and make sure if the bowler misses, I cash in.\"\n\nThe trouble was that Gleeson didn't miss. \"He bowled a great over,\" Jones said, amid emotions that were running high \"everywhere\".\n\nThough disappointed with the result, Jones called the match \"just great for cricket\" and was not too down about DSG's prospects especially as they came back from being dismissed for 86 by this same JSK side two days prior.\n\nDSG are third on the table with one win from four games and remain confident of their chances in this competition. \"We take this game as a good thing. We came quite close,\" Jones said. \"With the experience in our team, and a young fast bowler [Kwena Maphaka], we tick a lot of boxes. We'll keep our heads down, play good cricket, and I am pretty sure the results will take care of themselves.\"\n",

        "content": "### Bangladesh Announces T20 World Cup 2026 Squad: Taskin Ahmed Returns, Jaker Ali Dropped Amid India Travel Tensions\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officially announced its 15-member squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 on Sunday, January 4, 2026, bringing back experienced pacer **Taskin Ahmed** while dropping wicketkeeper-batter Jaker Ali, as part of a balanced lineup led by captain Litton Das.[1][2][3][4] This selection comes hours after escalating diplomatic tensions between India and Bangladesh prompted the BCB to seek relocation of its matches from India to Sri Lanka due to player safety concerns, triggered by the release of Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on BCCI instructions.[1][2][5][6]\n\n#### Key Facts and Squad Composition\nThe squad blends youth and experience, with Litton Das retained as captain and Mohammed Saif Hassan as vice-captain. Taskin Ahmed's inclusion marks his return after missing Bangladesh's recent T20I series against Ireland, where he was rested; he will spearhead the pace attack alongside Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, and Shoriful Islam.[1][2][3] The spin department features Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, and Nasum Ahmed, expected to exploit turning tracks in India and Sri Lanka.[1][4]\n\nThe full 15-member squad is:  \nLitton Kumar Das (captain), Mohammed Saif Hassan (vice-captain), Tanzid Hasan, Mohammad Parvez Hossain Emon, Tawhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Qazi Nurul Hasan Sohan, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, **Taskin Ahmed**, Md Shaifuddin, Shoriful Islam.[1][2][3][4]\n\nNotably absent is Jaker Ali, a wicketkeeper-batter who featured in recent series but was overlooked in favor of Litton Das (primary keeper-batter and captain) and Qazi Nurul Hasan Sohan as backup.[1][3] Batting responsibilities will heavily rely on Das, supported by openers Tanzid Hasan and Parvez Hossain Emon, with middle-order firepower from Tawhid Hridoy and Shamim Hossain.[1][4] Bangladesh, placed in **Group C** alongside England, West Indies, Nepal, and Italy, begins its campaign against the West Indies on **February 7, 2026**, with the tournament running from **February 7 to March 8, 2026**, across India and Sri Lanka. Only the top two teams from the group advance to the Super 8s.[1][3][4]\n\nBangladesh has participated in every T20 World Cup edition since 2007 but has never reached the semifinals, making this a historic opportunity for their maiden senior men's ICC title.[3][4]\n\n#### Timeline of Events\n- **Recent Background (Late 2025)**: Taskin Ahmed misses Bangladesh's T20I series against Ireland due to rest/rotation, opening the door for his World Cup recall.[2]\n- **Saturday, January 3, 2026**: BCCI instructs KKR to release Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad amid \"recent developments\" linked to India-Bangladesh tensions. KKR confirms: “Kolkata Knight Riders confirms that BCCI or IPL, as the regulator of IPL, has instructed it to release Mustafizur Rahman from the squad ahead of the upcoming Indian Premier League season. The release has been carried out following due process and consultations, upon the instruction of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. BCCI will allow Kolkata Knight Riders a replacement player in line with IPL regulations, and further details will be communicated in due course.”[5][6]\n- **Saturday Evening, January 3, 2026**: BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia states to PTI: \"The BCCI has asked Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman from its squad. They can ask for replacement, if needed. And upon request, BCCI will allow a replacement player... Because of recent developments all across.\"[5][6]\n- **Saturday Night, January 3, 2026**: BCB holds an emergency meeting to address the Mustafizur release and its implications for the World Cup.[6]\n- **Sunday, January 4, 2026 (Morning)**: Bangladesh's sports ministry instructs BCB to request ICC shift all league matches from India to Sri Lanka over \"concerns about players' safety.\"[1][2] BCB announces the squad via an official 'X' post: \"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has announced the national squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026, to be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka from 7 February to 8 March.\"[2]\n- **Sunday, January 4, 2026 (Ongoing)**: ICC has not yet responded to BCB's venue change request; BCCI describes any shift as a \"logistical nightmare.\"[7][8][9]\n\n#### Official Statements and Quotes\nThe BCB's squad announcement emphasized balance and leadership continuity, stating on 'X': \"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has announced the national squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026.\"[2] ICC's official site highlighted the team's potential: \"Led by Das, they would like to rewrite history in 2026 and would rely heavily on familiarity with the conditions and a balanced bowling attack led by experienced duo of Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed. Mahedi Hasan, Nasum Ahmed and Rishad Hossain will be more than handy on tracks that will assist turn making Bangladesh a real threat in the tournament.\"[4]\n\nBangladesh government advisor Asif Nazrul directed the venue shift: He \"instructed the Board to ask the Jay Shah-led ICC to shift Bangladesh's four league games -- three in India -- to Sri Lanka.\"[9] BCB has expressed \"apprehension over the safety of its players for the tournament.\"[5]\n\nBCCI's response has been firm. Secretary Devajit Saikia confirmed the KKR directive without elaborating on \"recent developments.\"[5][6] Reports indicate BCCI views the relocation request as creating a \"logistical nightmare,\" with no immediate concessions.[8][9]\n\nNo direct quotes from players like Taskin Ahmed, Litton Das, or Mustafizur Rahman were available in announcements, though media noted Taskin's return as a \"boost\" for the pace unit post-Ireland absence.[2]\n\n#### Latest Updates and Current Status\nAs of Sunday morning, January 4, 2026, the squad announcement stands firm, with Taskin's inclusion and Jaker's omission confirmed across BCB, ICC, and major outlets.[1][2][3][4] The primary development is the venue controversy: BCB is not withdrawing from the tournament but insists on moving its **four league games** (three scheduled in India) to Sri Lanka, citing security fears post-Mustafizur's release.[2][6][9] Sources confirm: \"The Bangladesh team is no longer willing to play its T20 World Cup matches in India, and want them to be shifted to Sri Lanka... The BCB isn't pulling out of the T20 World Cup.\"[6]\n\nICC remains silent on the request, while BCCI has pushed back, labeling it impractical.[8][9] No changes to the squad or schedule have been made. Bangladesh's campaign opener against West Indies on February 7 proceeds as planned unless ICC intervenes.[3][4]\n\nThis saga underscores broader India-Bangladesh strains, with Mustafizur—retained in the World Cup squad despite his IPL exit—symbolizing the friction.[1][3] Trusted sources like ICC, NDTV Sports, Hindustan Times, and Times of India consistently report the squad details and tensions without contradiction, focusing on confirmed facts.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n(Word count: 912)",
