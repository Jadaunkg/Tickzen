Bangladesh have left out Jaker Ali from their 15-member squad for the men's T20 World Cup 2026, while Litton Das stays on as captain and Taskin Ahmed returns to the side after missing the recent Ireland series.

Jaker has been dropped from the side for the first time since March 2024, having appeared in all 45 T20Is that Bangladesh have played during this period. However, he had been out of form and has even lost his place in Bangladesh's sides for the other formats, while also facing extensive criticism for his predominantly leg-side batting style, which has seen diminishing returns.

In-form batters - Litton, Tanzid Hasan and Saif Hassan - will make up the top three. Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain and Nurul Hasan slot into the middle order. While Parvez Hossain Emon could also be used at No. 4 after impressing in the role during the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL).

Bangladesh's major strength is their bowling. The returning Taskin has Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan, Shoriful Islam and Mohammad Saifuddin for company in an impressive pace department.

Rishad Hossain, meanwhile, will lead a spin attack that has left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed and offspinner Mahedi Hasan, with the latter specialising in powerplay bowling.

Bangladesh are scheduled to play their first three matches in Kolkata and the last one in Mumbai. However, the BCB is expected to write to the ICC with a request to shift their fixtures to Sri Lanka after Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released Mustafizur from their IPL 2026 squad following instructions from the BCCI.

CONTENT: **SCG Sizzle Fizzles: Ashes Day 1 Cut Short By Skies and Scrutiny**

Well, cricket fans, what a day it was – or, more accurately, *wasn’t*! The first day of the fifth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground promised fireworks, but instead, we got… well, a whole lot of sky-watching, head-scratching, and eventually, a chorus of boos.

Despite a massive crowd of 49,574 – the biggest for a Test at the SCG since way back in 1975-76 – turning up with high hopes, the weather gods, or perhaps the officials, had other ideas. England managed to chalk up a decent 211 for 3 from 45 overs before umpires Ahsan Raza and Chris Gaffaney took the players off the field. The kicker? This was a full 15 minutes *before* the scheduled tea interval!

What followed was a frustrating back-and-forth with Mother Nature and some rather strict protocols. First, lightning strikes in the Sydney area brought play to a halt, then rain showers joined the party. The rules state no play can resume until at least 30 minutes after the last lightning strike, which meant a loooong wait for the final session to even begin.

But here’s where it got really spicy: play was finally abandoned just after 5 pm local time – a whole half an hour before stumps were meant to be drawn – even though the rain had stopped! Groundstaff, apparently, decided against a clean-up operation because *more* showers were supposedly on their way. The announcement was met with a deafening wave of boos from the patient crowd, only for another quick burst of rain to follow shortly after, almost as if to say, “See? We told ya!”

And boy, did that get the pundits talking! Former England captain Michael Vaughan, never one to shy away from an opinion, was fuming on BBC’s Test Match Special. He reckoned we’d “sawn off the public” by “a couple of hours at least.” His main beef? The “mindset” in Test cricket. “In T20 cricket, you play in this,” Vaughan argued. “Test cricket is the one format that we do everything we possibly can to get off the pitch. The other two formats, we do everything we possibly can to get on the pitch. I just don’t understand why we don’t have that same mindset in Test match cricket.”

Jason Gillespie, the former Aussie quick, echoed the sentiment, telling ABC Radio that “Our game shoots itself in the foot time and time and time again.”

But what about the guys in the middle? Harry Brook, who top-scored for England with a brilliant 78 not out, offered a different perspective. He and Joe Root had zero qualms about walking off for bad light. “We could hardly see the ball when I was batting at the end,” Brook admitted. “Me and Rooty just said to [the umpires], ‘It’s so dark out here’. The Aussie boys were saying, ‘Are we going off?’ so everybody was pretty much in the same boat.” He added that they knew rain was coming and had pretty much accepted their fate.

Even Australia’s assistant coach, Daniel Vettori, initially admitted their players were a bit surprised by the abandonment, though he quickly added, “and then it rained again, so we stopped those thoughts.” When pressed on balancing player safety with entertaining the massive crowds, Vettori was classic diplomatic: “As a former player, I dreamed of rain, so I got to be mindful that I don’t change my tune too much.” He acknowledged the desire to play as much as possible but stressed the importance of rules and the unpredictable nature of weather.

So, there you have it – a day filled with more debate than actual cricket! Let’s hope for better fortunes tomorrow. To make up for the lost time, play will kick off 30 minutes early at 10 am local time on day two. Here’s hoping the skies are clearer and the only thing being cut short is a few Aussie wickets!

In a high-scoring match at a high-scoring ground at a high altitude, nobody wanted the ball more than Richard Gleeson, who stepped up to deliver the first Super Over in SA20 history for Joburg Super Kings (JSK) against Durban's Super Giants (DSG) on Thursday. With scores tied at 205 after 40 overs, the new year's day crowd at the Wanderers enjoyed an unexpected treat as Gleeson conceded only five runs in the Super Over and JSK then surged to victory and to the top of the points table.

"You don't want easy wins each game. They are great but it's moments like these where you are under pressure and you have to fall back on your skills, which gives you great confidence as a bowler," Gleeson said afterwards. "That's the big bit: trying to execute under pressure. You can practice as much as you want but when you get wet conditions, with the dew and you're under pressure with the crowd, it is difficult. I've got a few techniques that we use with the psychologist and I've done it quite a bit in the past. I just call on that experience to try and keep calm and keep a clear mind."

It was, in fact, the first time Gleeson has bowled a Super Over but he does have plenty of experience and success at the death. In 2022, he delivered the last over for Lancashire against Yorkshire in a Blast game that was tied because he dismissed Harry Brook off the final ball. Overall, since 2022, of bowlers who have delivered more than 400 balls in T20 cricket, Gleeson is the fifth best at the death (overs 17 to 20) in terms of economy rate (8.60) with 47 wickets at 13.82. Bear in mind that Jasprit Bumrah leads this list (6.65) and you have to understand how impressive Gleeson's numbers are.

At the Wanderers, Gleeson took 3 for 41 in DSG's chase in the regular game, which included bouncing Jos Buttler out for 15, removing Aiden Markram with DSG needing 38 runs off 21 balls, and bowling David Wiese with a yorker in the penultimate over. He was then tasked with the Super Over and could have had a wicket first ball when Evan Jones hit him to long-on but Matthew de Villiers put the chance down. That could easily have put Gleeson off and though he had fleeting thoughts that the dropped catch could cost JSK, he quickly put those aside. "[I thought], you've just dropped the match," Gleeson joked. "But I backed myself. I knew I was executing and the next ball was the most important."

As he delivered his second ball, Gleeson saw Buttler backing away and banged it in short and wide, away from where Buttler could connect with it well. He followed up with a yorker which Buttler could only squeeze away for one. Jones kept trying to swing big and inside-edged the next ball for one before Gleeson went short again to Buttler. He finished off with a yorker as DSG totalled just five and things had worked out exactly as Gleeson hoped they would.

"The plans going into the Super Over were really simple: to try and execute the yorkers, try and get them to hit to the longer part of the boundary but not be too predictable," he said. "I knew I had the short ball I could go to, pace off, so I just wanted to try and keep them guessing and have the batter thinking about two deliveries instead of just one."

That Jones, who had earlier brought DSG back into the match with personal highest SA20 score of 43 off just 17 balls, could not get Gleeson away was testament to the bowler's skills.

Jones' strategy during his match-tying innings was simple: "It's about standing still and make sure if the bowler misses, I cash in."

The trouble was that Gleeson didn't miss. "He bowled a great over," Jones said, amid emotions that were running high "everywhere".

Though disappointed with the result, Jones called the match "just great for cricket" and was not too down about DSG's prospects especially as they came back from being dismissed for 86 by this same JSK side two days prior.

DSG are third on the table with one win from four games and remain confident of their chances in this competition. "We take this game as a good thing. We came quite close," Jones said. "With the experience in our team, and a young fast bowler [Kwena Maphaka], we tick a lot of boxes. We'll keep our heads down, play good cricket, and I am pretty sure the results will take care of themselves."
