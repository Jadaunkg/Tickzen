      "content": "**The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced its 15-member squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 on Sunday, January 4, 2026, bringing back pacer Taskin Ahmed after his absence from the recent Ireland series while excluding wicketkeeper-batter Jaker Ali, though no explicit reasons for these specific changes were detailed in official statements.** [1][2][3]\n\n### Official Announcement and Timeline\nThe BCB revealed the squad via an official statement on 'X' (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, hours after instructions from Bangladesh's sports ministry to request shifting league matches from India to Sri Lanka due to safety concerns linked to Mustafizur Rahman's IPL release. [1][2][4] This came amid ongoing tensions, with the announcement positioned as preparation for the tournament in India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8. [1][2][3] Bangladesh is in Group C with England, West Indies, Nepal, and Italy. [1][3]\n\n### Taskin Ahmed's Inclusion and Jaker Ali's Exclusion\nTaskin Ahmed returns to the squad, partnering Mustafizur Rahman in the pace attack after missing the recent Ireland series; he is highlighted as a key experienced bowler alongside Mustafizur to lead the bowling. [1][2][3] Jaker Ali is not included in the 15-member squad, marking his exclusion, though reports do not specify direct reasons beyond the overall squad selection blending youth and experience. [1][2][3]\n\n### Reasons for Squad Changes\nSources describe the squad as a \"perfect blend of youth and experience,\" relying on Taskin's return for pace strength and spinners like Mahedi Hasan and Rishad Hossain for turning tracks, with batting anchored by captain Litton Das and openers like Tanzid Hasan. [1][3] No BCB quotes explicitly address Taskin's recall or Jaker's drop, but the selection emphasizes familiarity with conditions and a balanced attack. [3] The announcement coincides with unrelated travel concerns but focuses on team composition. [1][2]\n\n### Quotes from BCB Officials\nDirect BCB quotes are limited; the board stated: \"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has announced the national squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026, to be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka from 7 February to 8 March.\" [2] BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul has not commented officially on the squad. [7] Related context from Bangladesh's youth and sports adviser (not BCB): \"I have asked the BCB to explain the entire matter to the ICC... the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup.\" [4]\n\n### Complete Squad List\n- **Litton Kumer Das (Captain)**\n- **Mohammed Saif Hassan (Vice Captain)**\n- **Tanzid Hasan**\n- **Mohammad Parvez Hossain Emon**\n- **Tawhid Hridoy** (also listed as Md Tawhid Hridoy)\n- **Shamim Hossain** (also listed as Md Shamim Hossain)\n- **Qazi Nurul Hasan Sohan** (also listed as Quazi Nurul Hasan Sohan)\n- **Shak Mahedi Hasan** (also listed as Mahedi Hasan)\n- **Rishad Hossain** (also listed as Md Rishad Hossain)\n- **Nasum Ahmed** (also listed as Md Nasum Ahmed)\n- **Mustafizur Rahman** (also listed as Md Mustafizur Rahman)\n- **Tanzim Hasan Sakib** (also listed as Md Tanzim Hasan Sakib)\n- **Taskin Ahmed**\n- **Md Shaifuddin** (also listed as Md Shaif Uddin)\n- **Shoriful Islam** (also listed as Md Shoriful Islam)[1][2][3]\n\nNo further changes or updates to the squad were reported in the last 24 hours.
