CONTENT: 6 **Tigers Tweak: Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup 2026 Squad is Locked and Loaded!** Alright cricket fanatics, hold onto your hats because Bangladesh has just dropped their 15-member squad for the men’s T20 World Cup 2026, and there are definitely some eyebrow-raising inclusions and a major omission that’s got everyone talking! The biggest talking point has to be the surprising exclusion of **Jaker Ali**. Can you believe it? This guy has been a T20I staple for Bangladesh, featuring in *all 45* T20Is since March 2024. But, sadly, a dip in form and some serious criticism over his predominantly leg-side batting style – which, let’s be honest, hasn’t been delivering the goods lately – has seen him lose his spot, not just here but in other formats too. Tough break, Jaker! On the flip side, we’ve got some stability at the top with **Litton Das** retaining his captaincy – good call! And talk about a comeback: the fiery pacer **Taskin Ahmed** is back in the mix after missing the recent Ireland series. That’s a huge boost for the Tigers! Let’s talk willow power. The top three is looking solid with the in-form **Litton**, along with **Tanzid Hasan** and **Saif Hassan** ready to unleash. For the crucial middle order, we’ll see **Towhid Hridoy**, **Shamim Hossain**, and **Nurul Hasan** stepping up. Keep an eye on **Parvez Hossain Emon** too; he’s been impressing at No. 4 in the ongoing BPL and could definitely snag that spot! But where the Tigers truly roar is their bowling, and this squad really leans into that strength. Taskin’s return fortifies an already impressive pace battery that includes the ‘Fizz’ **Mustafizur Rahman**, the tenacious **Tanzim Hasan**, the left-arm swing of **Shoriful Islam**, and the all-round skills of **Mohammad Saifuddin**. That’s a serious pace attack, folks! And the spinners? They’re looking sharp too! **Rishad Hossain** will be leading the charge, supported by the crafty left-arm spin of **Nasum Ahmed** and the off-spin wizardry of **Mahedi Hasan**, who’s a known specialist in those crucial powerplay overs. Now, here’s a curveball for you! Bangladesh were originally slated to play their first three matches in Kolkata and the last one in Mumbai. BUT, the BCB is actually planning to write to the ICC to request a shift of all their fixtures to Sri Lanka! Why, you ask? Well, it seems Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released Mustafizur from their IPL 2026 squad following instructions from the BCCI. Talk about some behind-the-scenes drama! So there you have it, the full squad ready to make some noise at the T20 World Cup 2026: **Litton Das (capt), Saif Hassan, Tanzid Hasan, Parvez Hossain Emon, Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Nurul Hasan (wk), Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Taskin Ahmed, Mohammad Saifuddin, Shoriful Islam.** What do you guys think of this lineup? Any surprises for you? Let us know in the comments!

Bangladesh have left out Jaker Ali from their 15-member squad for the men's T20 World Cup 2026, while Litton Das stays on as captain and Taskin Ahmed returns to the side after missing the recent Ireland series.

Jaker has been dropped from the side for the first time since March 2024, having appeared in all 45 T20Is that Bangladesh have played during this period. However, he had been out of form and has even lost his place in Bangladesh's sides for the other formats, while also facing extensive criticism for his predominantly leg-side batting style, which has seen diminishing returns.

In-form batters - Litton, Tanzid Hasan and Saif Hassan - will make up the top three. Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain and Nurul Hasan slot into the middle order. While Parvez Hossain Emon could also be used at No. 4 after impressing in the role during the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL).

Bangladesh's major strength is their bowling. The returning Taskin has Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan, Shoriful Islam and Mohammad Saifuddin for company in an impressive pace department.

Rishad Hossain, meanwhile, will lead a spin attack that has left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed and offspinner Mahedi Hasan, with the latter specialising in powerplay bowling.

Bangladesh are scheduled to play their first three matches in Kolkata and the last one in Mumbai. However, the BCB is expected to write to the ICC with a request to shift their fixtures to Sri Lanka after Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released Mustafizur from their IPL 2026 squad following instructions from the BCCI.
