CONTENT: Open Extended Reactions

Bangladesh have left out Jaker Ali from their 15-member squad for the men's T20 World Cup 2026, while Litton Das stays on as captain and Taskin Ahmed returns to the side after missing the recent Ireland series.

Jaker has been dropped from the side for the first time since March 2024, having appeared in all 45 T20Is that Bangladesh have played during this period. However, he had been out of form and has even lost his place in Bangladesh's sides for the other formats, while also facing extensive criticism for his predominantly leg-side batting style, which has seen diminishing returns.

In-form batters - Litton, Tanzid Hasan and Saif Hassan - will make up the top three. Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain and Nurul Hasan slot into the middle order. While Parvez Hossain Emon could also be used at No. 4 after impressing in the role during the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL).

Bangladesh's major strength is their bowling. The returning Taskin has Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan, Shoriful Islam and Mohammad Saifuddin for company in an impressive pace department.

Rishad Hossain, meanwhile, will lead a spin attack that has left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed and offspinner Mahedi Hasan, with the latter specialising in powerplay bowling.

Bangladesh are scheduled to play their first three matches in Kolkata and the last one in Mumbai. However, the BCB is expected to write to the ICC with a request to shift their fixtures to Sri Lanka after Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released Mustafizur from their IPL 2026 squad following instructions from the BCCI.

CONTENT: **Sydney Showers, Shaky Starts, and a Sunset Stunner: Root & Brook Ride the Storm!**

Well, folks, here we are: the Ashes finale at the iconic SCG! And for a hot minute there, it felt like we were heading for *another* truncated Test, ready to punctuate a series that’s left a few of us feeling a bit, well, hollow. Remember those two-day wonders in Perth and Melbourne? Yeah, me too. But thankfully, England, Joe Root, and Harry Brook had other ideas, ensuring Day 1 in Sydney was anything but short on drama, even if the overs were!

Let’s dive in. The morning started sunny and humid – a pleasant surprise given the grim weather forecast later – and Captain Ben Stokes, after yet another toss win, decided to have a bat. Now, this was a *curious* call, especially considering his usual penchant for bowling first, which, let’s be honest, catalysed that fantastic MCG victory. His mood probably soured quickly as England’s top order found themselves battling some spicy seam movement on a green-tinged surface, collapsing to a wobbly 57 for 3 by mid-session. Uh oh, here we go again?

Before the wobble, though, opener Ben Duckett was absolutely *feasting* on Mitchell Starc’s usually fearsome but, on this occasion, unusually ragged bowling. Duckett, seemingly carrying all the momentum from his invaluable MCG cameo, whacked Starc for five boundaries in less than four overs, rocketing to 27 off just 23 balls! He and Zak Crawley looked like they were building something special – a partnership that has historically struggled to reach the eighth over this series, but here we were!

But alas, Starc finally found his rhythm, and Duckett, bless him, just couldn’t help himself, prodding tamely to a flying Alex Carey. Jacob Bethell, fresh from his calm Ashes debut, then tried to weather the storm but found himself caught between a rock and a hard place. Crawley, after another “teaser” of an innings, fell lbw to a full delivery from Michael Neser. Then Bethell nicked off to a relentless Scott Boland, who’d cleverly moved over the wicket. England, 57/3. Cricket Australia bigwigs were probably biting their nails!

But fear not, for the cavalry arrived! Enter Joe Root and Harry Brook. These two weren’t just batting; they were on a mission. The pitch, which had offered lively seam movement early on, started to ease up, and the duo settled in beautifully. They stitched together an unbroken 154-run stand – the *second-highest partnership of the series* for either side – ensuring England reached stumps in a much healthier position at 211 for 3.

Root, who’s had his struggles Down Under this series despite that brilliant ton in Brisbane, looked back to his trademark self, scoring heavily behind square on the off side after almost nicking off first ball! Brook, usually a whirlwind of aggression, was uncharacteristically restrained, keeping his madcap instincts in check for the most part. He still found a way to counter-attack, especially when Cameron Green, who endured a tough day finishing with 0 for 57 from eight overs, resorted to short-ball tactics. Brook even top-edged Starc on 45 before regrouping and whacking Beau Webster for a boundary to bring up a well-deserved 63-ball half-century, closely followed by Root’s own classy 65-ball fifty.

On the Australian side, the spotlight might just be shining on their selectors after a rather bold decision: stepping onto the SCG field without a specialist spinner for the first time since *1888*! With Beau Webster replacing Jhye Richardson, off-spinner Todd Murphy was left out. While the SCG has changed its spin-friendly traditions lately, Captain Steven Smith probably wished he had Murphy’s variety when Root and Brook were cruising. The frontline quicks each picked up a wicket, but variety was definitely lacking as the afternoon wore on.

Just as the clouds started to roll in and thick, ominous weather began to gather, play was halted due to bad light. While it cleared up briefly, the decision was made to call stumps after just 45 overs due to the earlier rain and lightning.

So, England finishes Day 1 at 211 for 3, with Harry Brook unbeaten on 78 and Joe Root on 72. This measured batting, combined with Sydney’s annual sketchy weather, surely means this match will last considerably longer than its two-day predecessors! A massive sigh of relief for SCG curator Adam Lewis, who bravely left just 5mm of grass on the pitch. Phew!

England’s hopes for a second consecutive consolation victory are shining brightly, and with Matthew Potts making his series debut (replacing the injured Gus Atkinson) and no Shoaib Bashir in the side, it’s all eyes on Day 2. Can Root and Brook continue their fantastic work? Will the Aussie bowlers find inspiration? And will the Sydney weather let us finish a whole day’s play? Bring it on!

CONTENT: Amid growing political tension, a Bangladeshi official voices concerns over safety of players in India during the upcoming tournament.

Bangladesh will request the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift its team’s T20 World Cup fixtures from India to Sri Lanka over concerns about its players’ safety, following the removal of a top Bangladeshi player from the Indian Premier League (IPL), a government official has said.

Amid growing political tension between the South Asian neighbours, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has been asked by its government to write to the ICC, requesting a change of venue for its games and seeking clarity on fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman’s abrupt removal from the IPL, youth and sports adviser Asif Nazrul said in a statement on Saturday.

“As the adviser in charge of the Sports Ministry, I have asked the BCB to explain the entire matter to ICC. The board should inform that where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup,” Asif wrote in a social media post.

“I have also instructed the board to request that Bangladesh’s World Cup matches should be held in Sri Lanka,” he added.

“We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances. The days of slavery are over.”

BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul said the board will hold an emergency meeting later on Sunday.

“The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time, keeping these in mind,” he told reporters late on Saturday.

Defending champions India and 2014 winners Sri Lanka will cohost the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 from February 7 to March 8.

Bangladesh are scheduled to play all their group-stage matches in India, with three fixtures allocated to Eden Gardens in Kolkata and one to the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.

Should the ICC – headed by former BCCI chief Jay Shah – consider the BCB’s request, Bangladesh will become the second country to have its games moved out of India.

Sri Lanka will host all of Pakistan’s matches as the 2009 champions will not travel to India in an ICC-brokered agreement that allows the bitter rivals to avoid travelling across their mutual border.

Earlier on Saturday, the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) confirmed that Mustafizur had been released from the franchise’s squad for IPL 2026 after the BCCI advised it to do so, and the move was confirmed by the Indian cricket board’s secretary, Devajit Saikia.

“Due to the recent developments which are going on all across, BCCI has instructed the franchise KKR to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad, and BCCI has also said that if they ask for any replacement, BCCI is going to allow that replacement,” Saikia told Indian news agency ANI.

Political tension spills over into sport

The ongoing tensions between India and Bangladesh have flared in recent weeks after a 25-year-old Hindu man was lynched and burned publicly in Bangladesh following allegations of blasphemy.

India’s Ministry of External Affairs last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities”.

A few days later, Hindutva activists tried to storm the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi as they rallied against the neighbouring nation for failing to protect its Hindu minorities.

Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, condemned the lynching, saying there is no space for such violence in the new Bangladesh.

“The perpetrators of this heinous crime will not be spared,” his office said in a statement. Two days later, 12 people were arrested in connection with the lynching, The Daily Star newspaper reported.

Last week, Bangladesh expressed concern over recent incidents of violence and killings involving minority communities in India, urging the authorities there to carry out impartial investigations and bring those responsible to justice.

“We expect the relevant authorities in India to conduct impartial investigations into these incidents and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson SM Mahbubul Alam said.

Diplomatic relations between the once-close allies have been sharply tested since August last year, when former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to New Delhi from Dhaka after an uprising against her rule.

Bangladesh blames India for some of its troubles, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support for Hasina when she was in power.

Political tensions have spilled over into sport in recent months, with the Bangladeshi women’s cricket team’s recent tour of India postponed indefinitely, and the Indian men’s team’s tour of Bangladesh meeting the same fate in August.

The BCCI’s move to have Mustafizur removed from the IPL has met with backlash in Bangladesh, where the popular franchise league may face a blackout.

Bangladeshi government official Nazrul said he had requested the national broadcasting body to “stop broadcasting of IPL tournament in Bangladesh”.

CONTENT: Led by Das, they would like to rewrite history in 2026 and would rely heavily on familiarity with the conditions and a balanced bowling attack led by experienced duo of Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed. Mahedi Hasan, Nasum Ahmed and Rishad Hossain will be more than handy on tracks that will assist turn making Bangladesh a real threat in the tournament.

The batting will rely heavily on the skipper but the likes of Tanzid Hasan and Parvez Hossain Emon will add much needed flair to the top order.

Bangladesh will be challenged from the word go as they find themselves in a tough group featuring England, West Indies, Nepal and Italy with just two teams advancing to the Super 8s.

CONTENT: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has been instructed by its sports ministry to seek shifting of the country's T20 World Cup league games from India to Sri Lanka as there are "concerns about players' safety" following Mustafizur Rahman's ouster from the IPL on BCCI instructions. The Shah Rukh Khan co-owned IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released the Bangladesh left-arm pacer, who was bought for Rs 9.20 crore after a bidding war at last month's auctions in Abu Dhabi, following BCCI's diktat.

BCB president and former Bangladesh skipper Aminul Islam Bulbul refrained from making any public comment after an Emergency board meeting following the development.

However, government advisor Asif Nazrul said he has instructed the Board to ask the Jay Shah-led ICC to shift Bangladesh's four league games -- three in Kolkata and one in Mumbai -- to Sri Lanka.

"As the adviser in charge of the Ministry of Sports, I have instructed the Cricket Control Board to put the entire matter in writing and explain it to the ICC," Nazrul wrote in Bengali on his Facebook page.

"The board must make it clear that if a Bangladeshi cricketer, despite being under contract, cannot play in India, then the Bangladesh national team cannot feel safe travelling to India to play the World Cup.

"I have also directed the board to formally request that Bangladesh's World Cup matches be held in Sri Lanka instead," he further wrote.

Bangladesh's four league games are -- against West Indies (February 7), Italy (February 9), England (February 14) in Kolkata followed by their last game against Nepal (February 17) in Mumbai.

A BCCI source, however, insisted that the shift is next to impossible with just a month left for the tournament.

"You can't just change games at someone's whims and fancies. It is a logistical nightmare. Think about opposition teams. Their air tickets, hotels are booked.

"Also on all days there are three games each which means one game is in Sri Lanka. There is broadcast crew. So it will be easier said than done," the BCCI source said.

India's arch foe Pakistan already is playing its World Cup games in Sri Lanka as per an understanding worked out months ago.

The Indo-Bangladesh relationship has plunged into chaos after the ouster of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India in August last year following anti-government protests.

She was sentenced to death in absentia by a tribunal for her alleged role in a deadly crackdown during the agitation in which several students were killed.

Although the BCCI did not explicitly cite the current political situation for its decision to seek Rahman's release, it did say that the move was triggered by what's been happening all around.

Hindus have been targeted for violent attacks since Hasina's ouster.
