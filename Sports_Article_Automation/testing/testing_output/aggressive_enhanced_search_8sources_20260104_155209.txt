After two consecutive seasons of finishing at the bottom of the points table in the WPL, Gujarat Giants (GG) turned a corner in 2025, reaching the playoffs. Will they go one step further this season?

Where they finished last year

Giants reached the knockouts for the first time in the Women's Premier League (WPL) last season, but lost the Eliminator to Mumbai Indians, who went on to lift their second WPL trophy. Giants had finished third in the league stage.

What's new in 2026

A lot. Giants retained just two players - captain Ashleigh Gardner and Beth Mooney - but made good moves at the auction to significantly strengthen their squad. New Zealand allrounder Sophie Devine was their biggest acquisition, for INR 2 crore.

They added several allrounders, including Georgia Wareham, Kim Garth, Kanika Ahuja and Ayushi Soni, while also bringing back the Indian core featuring Bharti Fulmali, Kashvee Gautam and Tanuja Kanwar - all of whom represented Giants the previous season.

CONTENT: Open Extended Reactions

Michael Vaughan led calls for a change in "mindset" among match officials and administrators after the first day of the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney was cut short owing to a combination of bad light, rain showers and lightning protocols.

A crowd of 49,574 - the highest attendance for a Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground since 1975-76 - watched England make 211 for 3 in 45 overs before umpires Ahsan Raza and Chris Gaffaney took the players off the field of play 15 minutes before the scheduled tea interval.

Lightning strikes in the Sydney area and rain showers prompted a delay to the start of the final session, with play unable to resume until at least 30 minutes after the most recent lightning strikes in the local area.

Play was finally abandoned just after 5pm local time - half-an-hour before the scheduled close - despite the rain stopping, with groundstaff opting against a clean-up operation due to the proximity of further showers. The announcement was met by boos from the crowd, although another quick burst of rain followed shortly after.

"From what I've seen in terms of the rain, the light and the conditions in the last hour or so, I think we've probably sawn off the public, who have paid their money in the ground today by a couple of hours at least," Vaughan, the former England captain, said on BBC's Test Match Special. "Through our time watching Test match cricket, this is the one format that we keep talking about [how] we need to do something to make sure that we're protecting it.

"In T20 cricket, you play in this. Test cricket is the one format that we do everything we possibly can to get off the pitch. The other two formats, we do everything we possibly can to get on the pitch. I just don't understand why we don't have that same mindset in Test match cricket."

CONTENT: Amid growing political tension, a Bangladeshi official voices concerns over safety of players in India during the upcoming tournament.

Bangladesh will request the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift its team’s T20 World Cup fixtures from India to Sri Lanka over concerns about its players’ safety, following the removal of a top Bangladeshi player from the Indian Premier League (IPL), a government official has said.

Amid growing political tension between the South Asian neighbours, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has been asked by its government to write to the ICC, requesting a change of venue for its games and seeking clarity on fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman’s abrupt removal from the IPL, youth and sports adviser Asif Nazrul said in a statement on Saturday.

“As the adviser in charge of the Sports Ministry, I have asked the BCB to explain the entire matter to ICC. The board should inform that where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup,” Asif wrote in a social media post.

“I have also instructed the board to request that Bangladesh’s World Cup matches should be held in Sri Lanka,” he added.

“We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances. The days of slavery are over.”

BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul said the board will hold an emergency meeting later on Sunday.

“The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time, keeping these in mind,” he told reporters late on Saturday.

Defending champions India and 2014 winners Sri Lanka will cohost the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 from February 7 to March 8.

Bangladesh are scheduled to play all their group-stage matches in India, with three fixtures allocated to Eden Gardens in Kolkata and one to the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.

Should the ICC – headed by former BCCI chief Jay Shah – consider the BCB’s request, Bangladesh will become the second country to have its games moved out of India.

Sri Lanka will host all of Pakistan’s matches as the 2009 champions will not travel to India in an ICC-brokered agreement that allows the bitter rivals to avoid travelling across their mutual border.

Earlier on Saturday, the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) confirmed that Mustafizur had been released from the franchise’s squad for IPL 2026 after the BCCI advised it to do so, and the move was confirmed by the Indian cricket board’s secretary, Devajit Saikia.

“Due to the recent developments which are going on all across, BCCI has instructed the franchise KKR to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad, and BCCI has also said that if they ask for any replacement, BCCI is going to allow that replacement,” Saikia told Indian news agency ANI.

Political tension spills over into sport

The ongoing tensions between India and Bangladesh have flared in recent weeks after a 25-year-old Hindu man was lynched and burned publicly in Bangladesh following allegations of blasphemy.

India’s Ministry of External Affairs last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities”.

A few days later, Hindutva activists tried to storm the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi as they rallied against the neighbouring nation for failing to protect its Hindu minorities.

Diplomatic relations between the once-close allies have been sharply tested since August last year, when former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to New Delhi from Dhaka after an uprising against her rule.

Bangladesh blames India for some of its troubles, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support for Hasina when she was in power.

Political tensions have spilled over into sport in recent months, with the Bangladeshi women’s cricket team’s recent tour of India postponed indefinitely, and the Indian men’s team’s tour of Bangladesh meeting the same fate in August.

The BCCI’s move to have Mustafizur removed from the IPL has met with backlash in Bangladesh, where the popular franchise league may face a blackout.

Bangladeshi government official Nazrul said he had requested the national broadcasting body to “stop broadcasting of IPL tournament in Bangladesh”.

CONTENT: Led by Das, they would like to rewrite history in 2026 and would rely heavily on familiarity with the conditions and a balanced bowling attack led by experienced duo of Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed. Mahedi Hasan, Nasum Ahmed and Rishad Hossain will be more than handy on tracks that will assist turn making Bangladesh a real threat in the tournament.

The batting will rely heavily on the skipper but the likes of Tanzid Hasan and Parvez Hossain Emon will add much needed flair to the top order.

Bangladesh will be challenged from the word go as they find themselves in a tough group featuring England, West Indies, Nepal and Italy with just two teams advancing to the Super 8s.

CONTENT: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has been instructed by its sports ministry to seek shifting of the country's T20 World Cup league games from India to Sri Lanka as there are "concerns about players' safety" following Mustafizur Rahman's ouster from the IPL on BCCI instructions. The Shah Rukh Khan co-owned IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released the Bangladesh left-arm pacer, who was bought for Rs 9.20 crore after a bidding war at last month's auctions in Abu Dhabi, following BCCI's diktat.

BCB president and former Bangladesh skipper Aminul Islam Bulbul refrained from making any public comment after an Emergency board meeting following the development.

However, government advisor Asif Nazrul said he has instructed the Board to ask the Jay Shah-led ICC to shift Bangladesh's four league games -- three in Kolkata and one in Mumbai -- to Sri Lanka.

"As the adviser in charge of the Ministry of Sports, I have instructed the Cricket Control Board to put the entire matter in writing and explain it to the ICC," Nazrul wrote in Bengali on his Facebook page.

"The board must make it clear that if a Bangladeshi cricketer, despite being under contract, cannot play in India, then the Bangladesh national team cannot feel safe travelling to India to play the World Cup.

"I have also directed the board to formally request that Bangladesh's World Cup matches be held in Sri Lanka instead," he further wrote.

Bangladesh's four league games are -- against West Indies (February 7), Italy (February 9), England (February 14) in Kolkata followed by their last game against Nepal (February 17) in Mumbai.

A BCCI source, however, insisted that the shift is next to impossible with just a month left for the tournament.

"You can't just change games at someone's whims and fancies. It is a logistical nightmare. Think about opposition teams. Their air tickets, hotels are booked.

"Also on all days there are three games each which means one game is in Sri Lanka. There is broadcast crew. So it will be easier said than done," the BCCI source said.

India's arch foe Pakistan already is playing its World Cup games in Sri Lanka as per an understanding worked out months ago.

The Indo-Bangladesh relationship has plunged into chaos after the ouster of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India in August last year following anti-government protests.

She was sentenced to death in absentia by a tribunal for her alleged role in a deadly crackdown during the agitation in which several students were killed.

Although the BCCI did not explicitly cite the current political situation for its decision to seek Rahman's release, it did say that the move was triggered by what's been happening all around.

Hindus have been targeted for violent attacks since Hasina's ouster.
