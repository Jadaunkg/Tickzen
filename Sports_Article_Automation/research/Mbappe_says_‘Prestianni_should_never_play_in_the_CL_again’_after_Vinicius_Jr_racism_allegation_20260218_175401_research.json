    "research_content": "# Comprehensive Research: Mbappé's Statement on Prestianni Following Vinícius Jr. Racism Allegation\n\n## Core Event and Verified Facts\n\n**Tier 2 - Sky Sports, ESPN, Euronews:** During Real Madrid's Champions League knockout playoff first leg against Benfica on Tuesday, February 18, 2026, Brazilian forward Vinícius Jr. scored the winning goal in the 50th minute at Estádio da Luz in Lisbon.[3][4] Immediately after celebrating the goal by dancing near the corner flag, Vinícius Jr. confronted Benfica midfielder Gianluca Prestianni, a 20-year-old Argentine player, alleging he had been racially abused.[3][4] The match was halted for 10 minutes when Vinícius Jr. reported the incident to French referee François Letexier, who activated FIFA's anti-racism protocol.[3][4]\n\n**Tier 2 - BeIN Sports, ESPN:** Kylian Mbappé, Real Madrid's French forward and teammate of Vinícius Jr., made explicit demands for UEFA sanctions against Prestianni in post-match statements.[1][2] According to Mbappé's account, Prestianni called Vinícius a \"monkey\" five times while covering his mouth with his shirt.[1][2] Mbappé stated: \"What I saw is very clear: number 25 said five times to Vini that you are a monkey. Everyone can have their opinion, but this kind of behavior is unacceptable.\"[1]\n\n## Mbappé's Specific Demands and Statements\n\n**Tier 2 - BeIN Sports, ESPN:** Mbappé explicitly called for the maximum possible UEFA sanction, stating that Prestianni \"doesn't deserve to play in the best competition, which is the Champions League.\"[1][2] In his mixed zone comments at Da Luz, Mbappé elaborated: \"I called him racist because I think he is. He tried to hide behind his shirt, but his face doesn't lie. This type of person is not a professional colleague. A young player cannot have the freedom to say things like this on a football field. It's a big problem, and we'll see what happens.\"[1]\n\nMbappé further emphasized the broader implications: \"We have to set an example for all the kids watching us. This behavior cannot be tolerated. I have nothing against Benfica or their coach, but a player like this does not deserve to play in the [Champions League].\"[1] He also defended Vinícius Jr.'s goal celebration on social media, writing: \"[Dance] Vinícius and please never stop. They will never tell us what we have to do or not.\"[2]\n\n## Supporting Testimony from Real Madrid Players\n\n**Tier 2 - Sky Sports, ESPN, Euronews:** Multiple Real Madrid teammates corroborated Vinícius Jr.'s account and supported Mbappé's position.[3][4] Midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni confirmed that Vinícius had told the team Prestianni called him a monkey.[3] Midfielder Federico Valverde added contextual analysis: \"If you cover your mouth to say something, it means what you're saying isn't right.\"[3] Right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold called the incident \"a disgrace to football\" and noted that Vinícius had been subjected to similar abuse multiple times throughout his career.[3]\n\n## Prestianni's Response and Benfica's Defense\n\n**Tier 2 - ESPN, Euronews:** Prestianni, 20, denied the allegations on social media, claiming that Vinícius Jr. \"misinterpreted what he thinks he heard.\"[2][3] Benfica midfielder Leandro Barreiro stated that Prestianni told teammates he had engaged in \"normal provocation between players during a match\" but denied using racist language.[3]\n\n**Tier 2 - Euronews:** Benfica published a video on social media arguing that the distance between players and stadium noise meant Madrid's squad could not have heard the alleged comments, drawing significant online criticism.[3] The club's defense emphasized that the last thing Benfica represents is racism, with coach José Mourinho noting that \"the biggest person in the history of this club was black,\" referring to legendary player Eusébio.[4]\n\n## Context: Vinícius Jr.'s History with Racist Abuse\n\n**Tier 2 - Sky Sports:** Mourinho acknowledged that Vinícius has been subjected to racist abuse multiple times throughout his career, stating: \"Vini has been subjected to this a few times throughout his career, there's no place for it in football or society. It's disgusting.\"[4] This context underscores why the incident escalated significantly and why Mbappé and teammates responded with such intensity.\n\n## UEFA Investigation Status\n\n**Tier 2 - Euronews:** UEFA is set to probe the racism allegations following the incident.[3] The investigation will determine whether disciplinary action is warranted and what sanctions, if any, will be imposed on Prestianni or the club.\n\n## Match Outcome and Significance\n\n**Tier 2 - Sky Sports, Euronews:** Real Madrid won the first leg 1-0, with Vinícius Jr.'s goal providing the decisive margin in this Champions League knockout playoff tie.[3][4] The match's significance extends beyond the sporting result, as it has become a focal point for discussions about racism in professional football and the enforcement of anti-racism protocols.\n\n## Source Tier Summary\n\nThe information presented is drawn primarily from **Tier 2 sources** (major broadcasters including Sky Sports, ESPN, Euronews, and BeIN Sports), which provide the most authoritative and comprehensive coverage of this incident. All statements from Mbappé, Vinícius Jr., and other players are directly sourced from these established sports media outlets with verified reporting from the match venue and post-match interviews.",
