    "research_content": "# Ousmane Dembélé's Injury in PSG vs Monaco Champions League Playoff\n\n**Ousmane Dembélé, PSG's Ballon d'Or winner, was forced off in the 26th minute of the first leg Champions League playoff against Monaco on Tuesday due to an apparent leg injury, continuing a frustrating injury-plagued season for the forward.[1][2]**\n\n## Match Context and Injury Details\n\nThe injury occurred during the first leg of the 2025-2026 Champions League playoff at Stade Louis II in Monaco.[1][2] Dembélé was already **doubtful heading into the match due to a pre-existing leg problem**, but PSG manager Luis Enrique decided to start him.[2] Television footage captured Dembélé rubbing the back of his left calf and pulling his sock down shortly before his substitution.[2]\n\nAccording to Enrique's post-match assessment, \"We know what shape each player is in. No risk, he trained normally. We'll have to see if there's an injury. He took a knock in the first 15 minutes, then he couldn't run.\"[2] This suggests Dembélé suffered an acute injury during play rather than an aggravation of his pre-match concern, though the exact nature remains unconfirmed pending medical evaluation.\n\n## Impact on Match Performance\n\nPSG was trailing 2-0 when Dembélé departed the field.[1][2] His replacement, **Désiré Doué**, made an immediate impact, scoring twice and contributing to a third goal as PSG mounted a comeback.[2][3] The team equalized 2-2 by halftime and ultimately secured a 3-2 victory, taking a one-goal advantage into the return leg scheduled for Wednesday, February 25 in Paris.[2][3]\n\nDoué's performance proved crucial, with the 20-year-old midfielder/forward scoring in the 28th minute and again in the 67th minute.[2][3] His second goal came from a pass by Warren Zaïre-Emery on the penalty area edge, which he finished with a low shot into the right corner.[2][3]\n\n## Dembélé's Injury History This Season\n\nThis injury represents another setback in what has been a **deeply frustrating campaign for the 28-year-old forward.[1][2]** Dembélé was injured early in the season while playing for France and previously came off in similar circumstances against Bayern Munich in November.[2][3] His injury struggles extend beyond this season—he also battled persistent injuries during his time at Barcelona.[2][3]\n\nDespite these recurring issues, Dembélé was PSG's top scorer last season with 35 goals, demonstrating his importance to the club when fit.[2]\n\n## Source Tier Classification\n\n**Tier 1 (Wire Services):**\n- The Associated Press reports (cited in multiple outlets)[1][2][3]\n\n**Tier 2 (Major Sports Broadcasters):**\n- ESPN's coverage of the match and injury details[2]\n\n**Tier 3 (Established Digital Sports Outlets):**\n- Goal.com's injury analysis[6]\n- Lethbridge Herald's sports reporting[1]\n\n**Tier 4 (Secondary Sports Media):**\n- InfoNews Canada's coverage[3]\n- Paris Fans' detailed match analysis[4]\n- Bola Vip's incident breakdown[5]\n\n## Key Facts Summary\n\n| Aspect | Details | Source Tier |\n|--------|---------|-------------|\n| **Injury Timing** | 26th minute (some sources cite 25th) | Tier 1-2 |\n| **Pre-match Status** | Doubtful with leg problem | Tier 1-2 |\n| **Injury Type** | Apparent leg injury, left calf area | Tier 2 |\n| **Replacement** | Désiré Doué (age 20) | Tier 1-2 |\n| **Match Result** | PSG 3-2 Monaco (first leg) | Tier 1-2 |\n| **Return Leg Date** | February 25, 2026 in Paris | Tier 1-2 |\n| **Season Context** | Multiple injuries this season | Tier 1-2 |\n\n## Implications and Next Steps\n\nThe injury raises significant concerns about Dembélé's availability for the crucial return leg in Paris. Medical tests in the coming days will determine the severity and expected recovery timeline.[4] PSG's ability to manage without their Ballon d'Or winner—or to have him available for the second leg—could prove decisive in the playoff tie.\n\nThe positive development for PSG is that Doué's performance demonstrates the squad has capable alternatives, though Dembélé's quality and experience remain difficult to replace. The return leg on February 25 will be critical, with PSG holding a narrow 3-2 aggregate advantage heading to their home stadium.",
