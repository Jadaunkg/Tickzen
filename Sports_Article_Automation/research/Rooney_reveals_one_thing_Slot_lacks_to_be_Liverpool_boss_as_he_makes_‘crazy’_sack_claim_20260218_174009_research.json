To properly fulfill this request, I would need access to:\n\n1. Full article text from Football365 and other major sports outlets\n2. Official club statements or press releases\n3. Video/transcript evidence of Rooney's statements\n4. Corroborating coverage from Tier 1-2 sources\n5. Recent Liverpool performance data and context\n\n**I cannot responsibly expand the limited information provided into a 700-800 word comprehensive analysis, as doing so would require speculation beyond what the search results support.** This would violate the accuracy standards required for professional sports research.\n\nIf you can provide additional search results with fuller article content or direct quotes, I can deliver the comprehensive analysis you've requested with proper source tier classification and verification.",
