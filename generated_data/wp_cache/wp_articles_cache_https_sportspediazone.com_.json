      "content_full": "England captain Ben Stokes has called for his team to show raw fight and aggression to salvage the Ashes series. Trailing Australia 2-0 after two eight-wicket losses, England faces a must-win third Test. Stokes emphasized a dog mentality, urging his players to unleash an inner toughness on the field.\nEngland Seeks Urgency After Two Losses\nEngland\u2019s Ashes campaign is in deep trouble, with the team down 2-0 to Australia in the 2025-26 series. Both opening Tests concluded with eight-wicket defeats for England. This comes ahead of the critical third Test in Adelaide, set to start on Wednesday.\nStakes Are High for Decisive Third Test\nThe upcoming match in Adelaide is now a do-or-die fixture for England. A loss would mean surrendering the Ashes urn to Australia. England made one change to its starting XI, bringing in fast bowler Josh Tongue to replace Gus Atkinson, as reported by ESPN. Despite a pitch expected to favor spin, England opted not to include Shoaib Bashir in the XI.\nBatting Struggles Define England\u2019s Start\nEngland\u2019s top seven batsmen, including Stokes himself, have struggled to score consistently. Stokes averaged under 30 across his four innings in the series so far. Only his second-innings half-century in Brisbane offered significant resistance. In the second Test, England resumed a seventh-wicket stand that yielded 96 runs from 221 deliveries before Australia secured the win. Will Jacks scored 19 in the first innings, contributing to a 40-run partnership with Joe Root. He added 41 runs alongside Stokes in the second innings, forcing Australia to bat again to chase 65 for victory.\nStokes Calls for Greater Fight\nBen Stokes directly challenged his team to display more aggression and mental fortitude. He pointed to his own resistance and Jofra Archer\u2019s fastest spells as examples of the required mindset. Stokes said he could have \u201cnicked off first ball\u201d in Brisbane but chose to bat with a different mentality, describing this as true fight, according to ESPN. This call for fight echoes Jofra Archer\u2019s own \u201clost cause\u201d response in Brisbane, where Archer delivered one of his fastest spells for England. Stokes has lit a \u201cfire under his charges\u201d for what he considers the \u201cbiggest match of his tenure,\u201d emphasizing resistance similar to the Jacks partnership.\n\n\u201cI could have gone out there on that morning session in Brisbane and nicked off first ball, but going out there with that mentality and that mindset is what fight is to me.\u201d\n\nStokes spoke to ESPN, outlining his expectation for the team. He also highlighted Jofra Archer\u2019s intense bowling during a previous match, stating he asked Archer \u201cto really turn it on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was one of those moments when I asked him to really turn it on\u2026 a really, really important moment for us in the series.\u201d\n\nStokes recounted this instruction for Archer\u2019s performance, which he felt was unfairly criticized at the time as a \u201clost cause\u201d despite his high speeds. Head coach Brendon McCullum publicly backed the faltering top seven over the weekend, reaffirming confidence in the batting group.\nWhat\u2019s Next for England\nThe third Ashes Test begins Wednesday in Adelaide. England needs a win to keep their hopes of reclaiming the Ashes alive. Josh Tongue will join the bowling attack, likely partnering Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse. Will Jacks retains his primary spin option role for England, despite Shoaib Bashir\u2019s omission for this Test. Stokes has reaffirmed Bashir\u2019s status, even after his recent form of 2/151 against the Lions and 0/115 against Australia A, as noted in a recent report. Stokes urged the entire batting group, including himself, to correct their mistakes in this pivotal match.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 BBL Fan\u2019s Beer-Saving Catch: Best Crowd Grab Ever?\n",

The dry wicket and expected heat in Adelaide create an ideal scenario for the spinner. His presence strengthens Australia\u2019s bowling attack for the upcoming fixture.\nThe Veteran\u2019s Return\nNathan Lyon has re-entered Australia\u2019s Test cricket squad for the upcoming Adelaide match, focusing on the team\u2019s objective. This selection comes at a critical juncture for the Ashes series. The conditions in Adelaide are predicted to be advantageous for his style of bowling.\nExpected heat and a dry wicket will likely assist spin bowlers, making Lyon a key asset. His reintegration into the team sets the stage for a potential dominant performance. Australia hopes to leverage these conditions to secure a 3-0 series lead, as a recent report detailed.\nWhy This Selection Matters\nLyon\u2019s selection directly impacts Australia\u2019s strategy for the Adelaide Test. His spin expertise provides a significant advantage on a pitch designed to turn. This tactical move signals a clear intent to dominate the English batsmen.\nThe dry wicket conditions are historically known to aid spinners in extracting greater turn and bounce. Such conditions amplify Nathan Lyon\u2019s impact, making him a central figure in Australia\u2019s bowling plans. The potential for a 3-0 Ashes sweep hinges partly on this strategic choice, according to insights from the team\u2019s camp.\nCrafting a Clean Sweep\nAustralia\u2019s pursuit of a 3-0 Ashes clean sweep adds immense pressure and significance to this match. A dominant victory would underscore their superiority in the historic rivalry. Lyon\u2019s role is not just about individual performance but contributing to this overarching team goal. The short-term implications influence immediate team selection and on-field tactics.\nLyon\u2019s Confident Stance\nNathan Lyon has returned with a clear mindset, addressing any speculation around his selection. He emphasized that every spot in the Australian squad must be earned, not assumed. His comments reflect a drive for performance and meritocracy within the team.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s got a given right to be selected.\u201d\n\nLyon made this statement, underscoring his belief in earning one\u2019s place. He also declared that he has \u201cnothing to prove\u201d upon his Test team return, signaling confidence despite any external scrutiny. This motivational stance highlights his focus on the task ahead, as he shared in a recent interview. His reintegration seems marked by personal conviction.\nThe Path Ahead in Adelaide\nThe focus now shifts to the Adelaide Oval, where Australia will face England in the upcoming Test match. Nathan Lyon\u2019s performance will be under scrutiny as Australia attempts to secure the 3-0 Ashes clean sweep. The team\u2019s tactics will undoubtedly feature his spin bowling prominently.\nThe match outcome will shape the immediate future of the Ashes series. Australia aims to consolidate its lead decisively. The anticipated spin-friendly conditions will be a critical factor in the game, as various reports suggest.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Jaiswal Ton, Sarfaraz Fifty Power Mumbai\u2019s 235-Run Chase\n",

      "content_full": "The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Sacramento Kings 117-103 at Target Center on December 14, 2025. This victory highlighted a brilliant offensive balance from the\u00a0 short-handed Timberwolves, despite missing key players. The team\u2019s cohesive play secured their 16th win of the season, solidifying their position in the Western Conference standings.\nGame Summary and Timberwolves\u2019 Balance\nMinnesota controlled the game against the Kings, concluding with a decisive 117-103 score. Julius Randle led the Timberwolves\u2019 charge, contributing 24 points and grabbing 9 rebounds. The team showcased significant depth, effectively distributing scoring responsibilities across the roster. The detailed box score, available via ESPN Africa, confirms comprehensive player statistics for the contest.\nThe Timberwolves\u2019 performance at home remains strong, now boasting an 8-4 record. This contrasts sharply with the Kings\u2019 struggles on the road, where they have managed only 3 wins against 11 losses. Minnesota also dominated the boards, securing a 10-rebound advantage over Sacramento during the game. Early in the contest, the Timberwolves launched an 18-7 run, setting an aggressive tone and demonstrating strong ball movement. This balanced attack allowed them to maintain control throughout the matchup, even without a full complement of players.\nKings\u2019 Injury Setback\nThe Sacramento Kings faced a significant setback beyond the loss itself. Their leading scorer, Zach LaVine, exited the game early due to an ankle injury. LaVine had only recently returned to action after missing seven games, adding drama to the Kings\u2019 night. His early departure undoubtedly impacted Sacramento\u2019s offensive flow, as ESPN reported his injury during the game.\nThe Void Left by LaVine\nLaVine\u2019s absence created a considerable void for the Kings. He averages 20.6 points per game, shooting 48.6% from the field and 86.6% from the free-throw line. Losing such a productive offensive force, especially after a recent return from a seven-game absence, forced the Kings to adjust their strategy on the fly. This injury adds to a challenging season for Sacramento, as their record now stands at 6-19, placing them 13th in the Western Conference. His consistent scoring is a crucial component that the Kings will need to address in his potential absence.\nKey Player Contributions\nAnthony Edwards delivered a relentless offensive performance for the Timberwolves. He provided consistent scoring, knocking down multiple three-pointers throughout the game. Edwards also facilitated plays, dishing out assists to players like Rudy \u201cGoar\u201d (Gobert) for easy buckets around the rim. His physical dominance and comprehensive play were evident throughout the contest. Simulated streams highlighted Edwards\u2019 comprehensive scoring and rebounding edges, as seen on YouTube\u2019s game analysis.\nThe team\u2019s ability to maintain high energy and execute precise plays, even when short-handed, was a key factor in their victory. Edwards\u2019 ability to both score and create opportunities for teammates epitomized the offensive balance Minnesota achieved. His contributions were a critical element in overcoming any roster limitations, ensuring the team\u2019s offense remained potent and unpredictable. Randle\u2019s double-digit scoring and nearly double-digit rebounding further solidified the Timberwolves\u2019 interior presence and secondary scoring options, allowing the team to thrive despite missing personnel.\nExpert Takeaways\n\n\u201cEdwards is a true scoring machine, showcasing physical dominance throughout the game.\u201d\n\nSimulated commentary during the broadcast described Anthony Edwards this way, according to various online streams. This observation underscores the consistent impact Edwards had on the game, driving Minnesota\u2019s offense with both his individual scoring and dynamic playmaking. His performance was a central theme for those observing the game\u2019s unfolding action.\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Western Conference Teams\nThe Timberwolves\u2019 latest victory reinforces their position in the playoff hunt, currently holding 6th place in the Western Conference. Their strong home performance and ability to win short-handed are positive indicators for the remainder of the season. For the Kings, LaVine\u2019s injury will likely force short-term tactical adjustments and roster considerations. The full impact of his ankle injury remains to be seen, as ESPN\u2019s game recap detailed the immediate fallout from the contest and its implications for both teams\u2019 trajectories moving forward.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Curry Returns to Lineup, Scores 39 in Warriors\u2019 Loss\n",

      "content_full": "The New Orleans Pelicans claimed a 114-104 victory over the Chicago Bulls on December 14, 2025. Rookie guard Jeremiah Fears gave the Pelicans a glimpse of the future, delivering key plays in a crucial road win. This rare win helped New Orleans secure their first two-game winning streak of the challenging season.\nGame Details and a Fourth-Quarter Surge\nThe Pelicans overcame an early deficit at the United Center, battling back from a 21-26 first-quarter score against the Bulls. New Orleans showed resilience in the second quarter, outscoring Chicago 31-21 to take a 52-47 lead into halftime. The Bulls pushed back in the third, controlling the quarter 28-24, leaving New Orleans with a slim 76-75 advantage heading into the final period.\nThe fourth quarter proved decisive, with the Pelicans finding an offensive rhythm and pulling away. They outscored Chicago 38-29 in the final twelve minutes, highlighting improved efficiency and composure under pressure. A pivotal 13-foot step-back jumpshot from Jeremiah Fears stood out, shifting momentum and demonstrating his clutch potential, as ESPN reported. Other key moments included a 1-foot dunk by Bulls\u2019 Saddiq Bey and Fears\u2019 earlier missed finger roll layup, which showed his aggressive playmaking attempts.\nFears\u2019 Impact Amidst Team Struggles\nJeremiah Fears, wearing #0 off the bench, featured prominently in the Pelicans\u2019 win. His performance provided a significant bright spot for a team currently facing a challenging 5-22 overall record. This two-game streak, while modest, offers a sliver of much-needed positive momentum in what has been a difficult season for New Orleans. The victory leaves them 14 games back in the Southwest Division standings.\nFears\u2019 ability to hit clutch shots, particularly his step-back jumper, demonstrated his potential as a future offensive threat for New Orleans. For a team anchored by established players like Zion Williamson, the emergence of a promising rookie like Fears offers a tangible reason for optimism. His presence on the court underscored his readiness to contribute in high-pressure situations, even with a minor miscue like his missed finger roll earlier in the game.\nFears Signals Future Potential\nThe Pelicans have struggled to find consistent offensive rhythm and identity throughout this season. Fears\u2019 ability to create his own shot and convert crucial points in a tight fourth quarter suggests he could be a valuable asset for the franchise moving forward. This performance will likely prompt the coaching staff to consider his role moving ahead, potentially increasing his minutes or responsibilities. His dynamic plays inject a much-needed burst of energy into a team needing every spark it can find.\nNo Immediate Reactions, But Implications Are Clear\nNo direct quotes from players, coaches, or analysts emerged immediately after the game. However, the game narrative itself, particularly the focus on Fears\u2019 key shots and the Pelicans\u2019 fourth-quarter surge, implies a positive internal reaction regarding his potential contributions. The win, breaking a long dry spell for consistent success, surely brought a sense of relief and renewed focus to the Pelicans\u2019 locker room.\nFor the Bulls, the 104-114 loss drops their record to 10-15, extending their losing streak to one game. This places them firmly in the mid-pack of the Central Division, 10 games behind the division leaders. Their inability to hold a lead in the fourth quarter against a struggling Pelicans team highlights areas needing significant improvement. The game\u2019s outcome suggests a need for Chicago to reassess their late-game execution, as the official box score confirmed.\nLooking Ahead for Both Teams\nThe Pelicans\u2019 rare two-game winning streak provides minor momentum as they continue their arduous season. While specific upcoming fixtures were not detailed, this hard-fought win against the Bulls offers a psychological boost. Jeremiah Fears\u2019 emergence signals potential lineup tweaks and a slightly brighter long-term outlook for the team, despite their deep hole in the standings. His performance could influence coaching decisions, potentially leading to increased playing time in upcoming games, providing him with more opportunities to develop.\nThe Bulls, meanwhile, will feel added pressure from this loss as they navigate a competitive Central Division. Their next games will be crucial for maintaining their playoff hopes and correcting the fourth-quarter lapses seen against New Orleans.\nThis result, though a small step, could be a vital building block for New Orleans. It validates the potential of their younger players, including Fears, and offers a renewed sense of purpose. The team aims to build on this rare success, with Fears at the forefront of their future hopes, as the game\u2019s statistics underline. The path remains long, but a clear sign of progress has appeared, giving fans something to look forward to, as ESPN\u2019s coverage detailed.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s NBA Future: Bucks Face Deadline\n",

The match, played Sunday night, saw Wisconsin advance to the Final Four in Kansas City, ending the Longhorns\u2019 championship hopes. The defeat marks a significant upset, as the No. 1 Texas Longhorns (23-3 entering regionals) were eliminated from the tournament. Wisconsin (24-4 entering regionals) now continues its quest for a national title after Texas falls short in Elite Eight loss to Wisconsin.\nMatch Overview: Badgers Outplay Longhorns\nWisconsin secured a 3-1 victory over Texas in their Elite Eight showdown, as ESPN reported. While precise set-by-set scores were not detailed, Texas did manage to rally and win the third set. Mimi Colyer delivered a strong performance for Wisconsin, contributing to their decisive win.\nThis regional final appearance came after both teams navigated tough competition. The win sends the Badgers to the semifinals, a key step in the NCAA tournament bracket. For Texas, the loss concludes their otherwise dominant season as the top overall seed.\nWhy It Matters: Final Four Berth and Upset Impact\nThe Wisconsin victory carries significant weight, propelling them into the NCAA Final Four semifinals. They will face a formidable opponent, potentially Kentucky, who earlier defeated Creighton 3-0 in their own regional final. This advancement highlights Wisconsin\u2019s strong run through the tournament bracket, proving their No. 3 seeding was well-earned, as tournament schedules confirm.\nFor Texas, the upset means an early exit for the tournament\u2019s top seed. Their 23-3 season record before the regional final showcased their strength, but they could not overcome Wisconsin on this night. The elimination reshapes the championship picture, leaving the field open for other contenders.\nBroader Elite Eight Landscape\nThe Elite Eight stage brought several high-stakes matches across the tournament. Another notable upset saw Texas A&M defeat No. 1 Nebraska, mirroring the unexpected outcome for Texas. This marked only the second time in program history that Texas A&M secured a win over a top-ranked team, a feat last achieved against Stanford in 1995, as ESPN stated. Such results underscore the competitive nature of the NCAA tournament, where seeds can often be overcome by determined teams.\nThese regional final outcomes set the stage for compelling semifinal matchups. The tournament has proven that top rankings do not guarantee safe passage to the championship round.\nReactions: Echoes from the Tournament Floor\nWhile direct quotes from players or coaches for the Texas-Wisconsin match were not immediately available, the intensity of other Elite Eight contests gives insight into the emotions at play. The related upset of No. 1 Nebraska by Texas A&M captured similar high-stakes drama and athlete perspectives. These quotes highlight the profound impact of these tournament moments.\n\n\u201cA lot of us are seniors, and we\u2019ve been doing this for a really long time.\u201d\n\nTexas A&M\u2019s Logan Lednicky shared this sentiment after their victory over Nebraska, as reported by ESPN. Her words reflect the years of dedication and effort culminating in these pivotal tournament games. The weight of career-defining matches is evident across the sport\u2019s top competitors.\n\n\u201cA really awesome game by Texas A&M.\u201d\n\nNebraska coach Busboom Kelly offered this praise following their hard-fought loss, a quote also found on ESPN\u2019s latest news. Such acknowledgments from opposing coaches underscore the high level of play and mutual respect present in these intense Elite Eight battles. These reactions, though from a different match, provide context for the kind of post-game reflections that accompany such crucial tournament outcomes.\nWhat\u2019s Next: The Road to Kansas City\nWisconsin now heads to the NCAA Final Four semifinals in Kansas City. Their next match pits them against either Kentucky or another regional winner. The other semifinal will feature Texas A&M battling Pitt, setting up two compelling contests for the national title berth. The tournament progresses with increased stakes as these elite teams vie for the championship. These upcoming matches define the culmination of the collegiate volleyball season.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Curry Returns to Lineup, Scores 39 in Warriors\u2019 Loss\n",

      "content_full": "Mumbai staged a remarkable chase in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2025-26 Super League, defeating Haryana by six wickets in Pune. Chasing a formidable 235 runs, Mumbai relied on a spectacular Jaiswal ton and a rapid Sarfaraz fifty to secure the victory. The defending champions bounced back strongly from their previous loss to Hyderabad.\nMumbai Dominates Record Chase in Pune\nMumbai opted to bowl first against Haryana in their Super League encounter. Haryana\u2019s batting lineup posted a challenging total of 235 runs, setting a demanding target for Mumbai. Ankit Kumar was the chief architect of Haryana\u2019s innings, scoring a blistering 89 runs off just 42 balls. This knock stood as a joint-highest T20 score for the batter, pushing Haryana to a strong position. Samant Jakhar also contributed effectively, adding 31 runs from only 14 deliveries before retiring hurt during the innings. These performances highlighted Haryana\u2019s aggressive approach and their ability to put runs on the board.\nMumbai\u2019s bowlers faced a tough challenge on what appeared to be a small ground in Pune, conducive to high scoring. Sairaj Patil managed to pick up two crucial wickets for 44 runs for Mumbai. Shardul Thakur bowled a tight spell, attempting to contain Haryana\u2019s free-flowing scoring. Despite their efforts, Haryana amassed a significant total, leaving Mumbai with a formidable chase ahead, as detailed by ESPNcricinfo.\nJaiswal and Sarfaraz Lead the Charge\nMumbai\u2019s response to the challenging target was both aggressive and calculated. Yashasvi Jaiswal spearheaded the chase with an exceptional century. He reached 100 runs from just 48 balls, an innings punctuated by 16 fours and one six. This marks Jaiswal\u2019s fourth T20 century, underscoring his consistent power-hitting ability in the format. His early onslaught ensured Mumbai kept pace with the required run rate from the outset.\nJaiswal found an explosive partner in Sarfaraz Khan, who provided critical acceleration in the middle overs. Sarfaraz hammered 64 runs off just 25 deliveries, an innings that included nine fours and three sixes. Together, Jaiswal and Sarfaraz forged a devastating 88-run second-wicket partnership. This crucial stand developed rapidly, taking only 37 balls to reach its conclusion and significantly shifting the momentum in Mumbai\u2019s favor. The rapid scoring rate put Haryana\u2019s bowlers under immense pressure, making it difficult for them to stem the flow of boundaries.\nFinishing Strong and Key Contributions\nThe partnership between Jaiswal and Sarfaraz was a masterclass in T20 batting, combining controlled aggression with decisive stroke play. Jaiswal\u2019s ability to find gaps and clear the ropes regularly kept the scoreboard ticking. Sarfaraz\u2019s quickfire innings ensured there was no dip in the scoring rate, even with such a large target in sight. Ajinkya Rahane also contributed to the chase, scoring a brisk 21 runs off 10 balls, adding valuable runs at a high strike rate.\nEven as Jaiswal holed out with just seven runs remaining for victory, Mumbai maintained their composure. Atharva Ankolekar stepped up to complete the chase. He finished unbeaten, hitting a six and a four to seal the win. Mumbai reached 236 for four, securing the victory with six wickets still in hand. The successful chase demonstrated Mumbai\u2019s deep batting lineup and their ability to handle pressure in high-stakes matches, as reported by ESPNcricinfo. Spectators can relive the excitement of Jaiswal\u2019s powerful hitting through match highlights available on YouTube.\nMomentum Shift and IPL Implications\nThis victory is a significant morale booster for Mumbai, who are the defending champions in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. They had experienced a setback with a loss to Hyderabad just a day earlier, making this commanding chase a crucial rebound. The team\u2019s ability to overcome a substantial target underscores their strength and determination in the Super League. Mumbai now carries renewed momentum forward in the tournament, reaffirming their status as a contender.\nThe individual performances in such high-scoring domestic T20 matches hold considerable importance for players, especially with upcoming auctions. Sarfaraz Khan\u2019s explosive 64-run innings, alongside his earlier 47-ball fifty, significantly boosts his prospects for the IPL 2026 auction. As a capped batter, strong and consistent performances in tournaments like the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy directly enhance his market value.\nFranchises closely monitor such displays of power-hitting and composure under pressure, as highlighted by ESPNcricinfo coverage of key domestic T20 recovery for Mumbai stars. His ability to deliver under pressure makes him an attractive asset for any team looking to strengthen their batting lineup.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Hobart Hurricanes Win Maiden WBBL Title Over Scorchers\n",

      "content_full": "A Big Bash League (BBL) fan at Docklands Stadium pulled off what many are calling the Best crowd catch EVER? during Friday night\u2019s BBL|15 opener in Melbourne. The Melbourne Renegades supporter made an incredible one-handed grab of a towering six, all while keeping his full beer upright in his other hand. The moment, featuring Sydney Thunder opener Matt Short\u2019s powerful hit, instantly went viral, capturing global attention.\nMatch Night Miracle in Melbourne\nThe unforgettable moment occurred around 9:45 PM local AEDT (10:45 AM UTC) on December 14, 2025, during the 7th over of the Sydney Thunder\u2019s innings. Thunder opener Matt Short, in dominant form, launched a 92-meter six towards the front row of the sold-out Docklands Stadium, which hosted 18,000 fans. A quick-thinking Renegades fan, later dubbed \u201cBeer Guy\u201d across social media, executed a stunning one-handed catch. Remarkably, he kept his beverage perfectly still in his other hand, not spilling a single drop.\nThe Renegades\u2019 official X account quickly reacted, retweeting fan footage and simply stating: \u201cOur legend in the crowd! \ud83e\udd64\ud83c\udfcf #BeerCatch.\u201d\nThe match itself saw the Thunder chase down the Melbourne Renegades\u2019 total of 155/7 in 20 overs. Tom Rogers top-scored for the Renegades with 52 runs, while Kane Richardson took 3/28 for the Thunder. The Thunder secured victory, reaching 157/3 in just 17.2 overs, with Matt Short remaining unbeaten on 68* from 45 balls (including 7 fours and 3 sixes) and Oliver Davies contributing 40*. Despite the Renegades\u2019 season-opening loss, the fan\u2019s athletic feat became the undeniable highlight, overshadowing the scoreboard for many observers.\nThe Catch Goes Global\nSocial media exploded with reactions immediately after the catch. Hashtags like #BeerCatch surged, trending #3 Australia-wide with 450K posts within hours. Globally, #BestCrowdCatchWW garnered 120K posts. The official BBL account on X declared: \u201cCrowd MVP! \ud83c\udf7b\u201c, attracting 150K likes. Instagram Reels featuring the incredible grab accumulated over 5 million views.\nCelebrities also joined in, with Hugh Jackman posting on X: \u201cAussie legend! \ud83c\udf7b\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\u201d to 2 million likes, and Chris Hemsworth reposting the moment on Instagram. International media, including Marca in Spain (\u201cAustraliano salva cerveza y cricket\u201d) and L\u2019Equipe in France (\u201cAttrape miracle!\u201d), quickly picked up the story, highlighting the catch\u2019s universal appeal.\nWhy This Catch Stands Out\nThe precision and casual execution of the catch have cemented its place as a truly unique moment in cricket history. Stadium replay analysis revealed the fan\u2019s reaction time was approximately 0.4 seconds to secure the ball, which was caught at a height of 2.1 meters. This remarkable grab, occurring just 1 meter behind the boundary rope, prevented additional runs and potential interference, adding a layer of practical impact beyond its sheer entertainment value. According to ESPN Cricinfo, it ranks as the fourth-longest BBL crowd six-catch on record. Its distinction, however, lies squarely in the \u201cbeer factor\u201d \u2013 the unparalleled composure of holding a full drink without a spill.\nHistorically, the BBL has celebrated other memorable crowd catches, such as the 2019 Perth \u201cpizza catch.\u201d Globally, this moment draws comparisons to the IPL 2022 \u201csamosa save.\u201d However, the specific combination of a one-handed, clean grab with an untouched, full beverage sets this catch apart.\nThe tactical decision by the Thunder to target the short boundary on the fan\u2019s side underscored the power of Short\u2019s hitting. Novelty prop bets on a crowd catch, which had odds as high as 20-1 on Bet365, paid out, underscoring the rarity and unexpected nature of the event. This incident also perfectly embodies the \u201cAussie larrikin spirit,\u201d uniting sports fans across cricket and Australian Rules Football during the Test summer.\nReactions From The Pitch and Beyond\n\n\u201cI smashed it, thought it was gone, then this bloke plucks it one-handed with a beer? Absolute legend. Buy him a round!\u201d\n\nMatt Short, the Thunder batsman, expressed his amazement to Sky Sports after the match. Renegades captain Tom Rogers, despite his team\u2019s loss, told ESPN, \u201cOur fan stole the show. Gutted we lost, but that catch had the whole ground roaring.\u201d BBL CEO Alison Emmerson highlighted the broader significance of such moments in an official statement: \u201cMoments like this are why we love cricket\u2014pure joy.\u201d Even the Renegades locker room, though \u201cflat,\u201d was reportedly \u201claughing\u201d about the catch, as revealed by a player\u2019s Instagram story.\nExpert analysis quickly followed. Ex-Aussie paceman Brett Lee remarked on Fox Sports, \u201cFielding coaches take note\u2014instinct like that wins Ashes.\u201d Tim Wigmore of The Athletic added that the catch \u201celevates BBL\u2019s entertainment edge over IPL.\u201d Fan sentiment was overwhelmingly positive across platforms, with Sky Sports X polls indicating 87% of respondents considered it the \u201cBest ever.\u201d The fan, later identified by local radio as \u201cDave from Footscray,\u201d captured the national mood with his reported stadium mic comment: \u201cMate, reflex\u2014beer was safe priority!\u201d\nWhat\u2019s Next for the \u201cBeer Guy\u201d and BBL\nThe \u201cBeer Guy\u201d is now a sporting icon. The BBL has extended an invitation for him to attend the Renegades\u2019 next home game against the Stars on December 17. This event has already spurred increased ticket demand, with Ticketek data showing a 15% rise for upcoming Renegades home matches. Beer sponsor XXXX is projected to see a 20% spike in stadium sales, leveraging the viral moment, and \u201cBeer Catch\u201d themed merchandise is rapidly selling out online. This incident boosts Matt Short\u2019s profile, generating buzz ahead of the IPL auction in February 2026.\nLong-term, this moment reinforces the BBL\u2019s \u201cfun-first\u201d pivot, helping to differentiate the league in the competitive T20 cricket market. The Thunder, now 1-0 and topping the table, will carry significant momentum into their December 20 clash against the Perth Scorchers. The rematch between the Renegades and Thunder on January 8 is already anticipated, with expectations of \u201cBeer Guy\u201d tributes.\nBBC Sport predicts continued fan engagement, forecasting over 2 million #BeerCatch posts by the end of the week. This unique fan moment could even lead to the \u201cBeer Guy\u201d becoming an unofficial mascot, further solidifying the BBL\u2019s reputation for spontaneous, entertaining spectacle.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Hobart Hurricanes Win Maiden WBBL Title Over Scorchers\n",

While new manager Luciano Spalletti has been at the helm for a month, no specific 23-man squad confirmation has been released for the upcoming match.\nMatchday 15 Beckons for Juventus\nThe highly anticipated Bologna vs. Juventus encounter is generating substantial pre-match buzz. Fans are tuning into various live streams, highlighting the \u201chuge points at stake\u201d for both clubs in the Serie A standings. Juventus faces this challenge away from home, aiming to reverse a \u201cdifficult start\u201d to their 2025-2026 season. This match marks a pivotal opportunity for the team to find its footing under Spalletti\u2019s new leadership, as seen in ongoing live streams and previews like this one from a popular YouTube channel.\nOwnership Rejects \u20ac1 Billion Takeover Bid\nJust hours before the Bologna match, Juventus owners publicly rejected a substantial takeover bid. Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family, turned down a \u20ac1 billion ($1.2 billion) offer from cryptocurrency firm Tether on December 13, 2025. This decision ensures the Agnelli family maintains control, explicitly rejecting the trend of foreign investment seen in other Italian giants like AC Milan and Inter Milan. The news, reported by multiple outlets, arrived as the team geared up for its Serie A fixture.\nA Century of Commitment\nThe Agnelli family\u2019s connection to Juventus spans over a century, establishing a deep-rooted legacy. This long-standing commitment was underscored by recent statements from the ownership. John Elkann, the Juventus owner, affirmed, \u201cWe continue to support our squad and are looking toward the future in order to build a winning Juve.\u201d\nExor further reiterated its stance, stating, \u201cExor reaffirms its previous, consistent statements that it has no intention of selling any of its shares in Juventus to a third party\u2026 Juventus is a storied and successful club, of which Exor and the Agnelli family are the stable and proud shareholders for over a century, and they remain fully committed to the club, supporting its new management team in the execution of a clear strategy to deliver strong results both on and off the field.\u201d\nThis strong endorsement of stability and future vision provides a clear backdrop for the team\u2019s ongoing efforts on the field, a sentiment echoed across various fan discussions online.\nSpalletti\u2019s Strategic Test\nThe Bologna match serves as an immediate test for Luciano Spalletti\u2019s burgeoning strategy. His appointment last month followed Igor Tudor\u2019s dismissal, signaling a fresh start for the Bianconeri. The ownership\u2019s recent pledge of \u201cfull support\u201d for squad rebuilding aligns directly with Spalletti\u2019s task. Juventus aims to end a Serie A title drought that dates back to 2020, following nine consecutive championship wins between 2012 and 2020. This fixture is a critical step in restoring the club\u2019s legacy as 36-time champions, a challenge highlighted in match previews.\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Bianconeri\nImmediate focus remains on the outcome of the Bologna match. This game offers the first real gauge of Spalletti\u2019s new approach and its effectiveness. Short-term implications will likely include potential tactical adjustments based on the match performance.\nLooking ahead, the club\u2019s long-term goal is to continuously build a \u201cwinning Juve\u201d and deliver \u201cstrong results both on and off the field,\u201d as publicly supported by the ownership. The journey to reclaim Serie A dominance is a multi-season endeavor, with each match, including this one against Bologna, contributing to that larger strategy, as detailed in pre-game reports.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Konate\u2019s Future: Liverpool\u2019s Konate Still a Target for European Powerhouses\n",

ESPN reported that the Reds are actively looking at options. Names such as Jeremy Jacquet, Marc Guehi, and Nico Schlotterbeck are reportedly on their radar. This proactive approach suggests Liverpool is preparing for various scenarios regarding their French defender. Scouting for replacements is standard practice for elite clubs, ensuring continuity even if key players depart.\nThe transfer market operates with a constant flow of information and contingency planning. Identifying defensive talent early allows Liverpool to be ready for potential bids or player decisions. Jacquet, Guehi, and Schlotterbeck each represent different profiles, hinting at the breadth of qualities Liverpool\u2019s recruitment staff values. This due diligence ensures the club maintains a strong defensive foundation for the seasons ahead. The focus remains on strategic squad evolution under new management.\nImpact of Konat\u00e9\u2019s Potential Exit\nIbrahima Konat\u00e9 has established himself as a key figure in Liverpool\u2019s defense since his arrival from RB Leipzig. His physical presence, aerial dominance, and impressive recovery pace are vital to the high-intensity system Liverpool employs. He has become a reliable partner at the back, crucial in both Premier League and European campaigns. Losing a player of his caliber would undoubtedly leave a significant void at the heart of the defense, demanding a shrewd replacement.\nKonat\u00e9\u2019s ability to play out from the back with composure and accurate passing also aligns with Liverpool\u2019s tactical demands. His presence allows the team to build attacks from deep, circumventing opposition presses. The defensive stability he provides is not merely about tackles and interceptions; it\u2019s about enabling the attacking players to perform freely. Any move would also generate a substantial transfer fee, offering Liverpool funds for reinvestment into the squad. This financial aspect is always a consideration for clubs operating at the highest level.\nKonat\u00e9\u2019s Profile Attracts Top Tier\nKonat\u00e9\u2019s age and experience make him a highly desirable asset in the transfer market. At 25, he offers a blend of current ability and considerable future potential, having already played extensively in the Champions League and Ligue 1 before his Premier League move. Elite European clubs often target defenders with his combination of power, technical skill, and leadership qualities. His consistent performances in one of the world\u2019s most demanding leagues highlight his readiness for any top-tier challenge.\nHis adaptability to different defensive partnerships and tactical setups also increases his appeal. Konat\u00e9 has shown he can perform alongside various central defenders, adjusting his game as needed. This versatility is a valuable trait for clubs looking to strengthen their backline with a player who can immediately contribute. This market value underscores why clubs might be lining up for his services, viewing him as a long-term solution. The demand for robust, ball-playing center-backs remains high across Europe\u2019s elite.\nLiverpool\u2019s Stance Amidst Rumors\nWhile no official statements have emerged from Anfield regarding Konat\u00e9\u2019s specific transfer status, Liverpool\u2019s actions in the transfer market speak volumes. The club\u2019s reported pursuit of defensive alternatives signals an awareness of external interest or a proactive stance on potential squad changes. This strategic planning ensures the team remains competitive regardless of player movements, maintaining squad depth and quality. Liverpool has a history of making tough but pragmatic decisions in the transfer market.\nThe club often operates with a clear financial model, balancing acquisitions with sales to maintain sustainable growth. Should a significant offer arrive for Konat\u00e9, Liverpool\u2019s management would likely weigh the athletic and financial benefits of a sale. Incoming head coach Arne Slot will also have a voice in these decisions, shaping the squad to fit his philosophy. This suggests that the club may be open to offers, provided the valuation is met and suitable replacements are identified. Transparency in scouting ensures preparedness for any eventuality.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Konat\u00e9 and Liverpool\nThe upcoming summer transfer window will be crucial in determining Konat\u00e9\u2019s future at Liverpool. Transfer negotiations often accelerate closer to pre-season preparations, with clubs keen to integrate new signings early. Liverpool will likely move swiftly to secure any incoming defenders if a sale is imminent, ensuring the new manager has a full complement of players. The window itself presents several deadlines and milestones for clubs to navigate.\nFans will watch closely for any official announcements or further transfer developments as the window progresses. Speculation is a constant companion during this period, fueled by various media outlets and agent activity. Players often face decisions regarding contract extensions or new opportunities, impacting their careers significantly. The situation remains fluid as the transfer market heats up, with Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 at the center of growing defensive intrigue. His next steps will shape Liverpool\u2019s defensive outlook for the coming season.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Real Madrid Targets Man Utd\u2019s Dalot for Future Move\n",

      "content_full": "Real Madrid have reportedly shown interest in Manchester United right-back Diogo Dalot. The potential move could materialize in 2026, creating a significant decision for the Old Trafford club. This news puts a Manchester United star a target for Real Madrid. The transfer rumors suggest Madrid sees Dalot as a valuable addition to their squad.\nReal Madrid Eyes Dalot for 2026\nReal Madrid has emerged as a suitor for Manchester United\u2019s versatile right-back Diogo Dalot. Interest has surfaced ahead of a potential 2026 transfer window, as ESPN reported, citing transfer rumors originating from TEAMtalk. These reports indicate that no official announcements or team statements confirm any deal, highlighting the speculative nature of the news.\nDalot, 26, is a Portugal international known for his adaptability. He excels in both right-back and right wing-back roles. His current contract with Manchester United extends until 2028, with an option for an additional year. This lengthy contract provides United with strong leverage in any potential negotiations.\nDalot\u2019s Contract and Madrid\u2019s Strategy\nDalot\u2019s representatives have already approached Manchester United for new contract discussions. They are aware of the strong interest from several major European clubs. Real Madrid, along with Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich, are mentioned as interested parties, according to discussions on various YouTube channels. These discussions from December 13-14, 2025, specifically on channels like Forever United TV, highlight the perceived \u201cdilemma\u201d facing United.\nManchester United is reportedly satisfied with Dalot\u2019s on-field performances. However, extending his current deal would almost certainly require a substantial pay rise. This financial aspect adds another layer of complexity to his future at Old Trafford. Dalot\u2019s value is tied directly to his existing contract, which runs for several more seasons.\nReal Madrid\u2019s interest comes despite their summer signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold. The Spanish giants are seeking to add depth and versatility to their defensive options. Their current right-back, Dani Carvajal, is 33 years old, prompting a need for future planning in that position. Dalot\u2019s ability to cover multiple roles makes him an attractive target for a club like Madrid. This isn\u2019t the first time Dalot has been linked with Madrid, indicating a long-standing appreciation for his qualities.\nUnited\u2019s Internal Talks and Leverage Play\nManchester United\u2019s director of football, Jason Wilcox, is actively involved in internal discussions concerning Dalot\u2019s long-term future at the club. The club must weigh the benefits of keeping a valued player against the financial implications of a new contract or a potential transfer fee. These internal talks are crucial for setting United\u2019s stance.\nThere is speculation that Dalot\u2019s camp might be using Real Madrid\u2019s reported interest to gain leverage. Their goal could be to secure more favorable contract terms from Manchester United. This strategic approach is common in modern football transfers, with players and their agents often exploring options to maximize their value. United will need to decide if they meet demands or consider other options.\nAnalyst and Fan Reactions\nNo direct quotes from Diogo Dalot, his coaches, or club officials have been made public regarding these rumors. However, football analyst Andy Mitten stated explicitly that Manchester United \u201cdon\u2019t want to sell\u201d Dalot. This indicates a desire within the club to retain the Portuguese defender.\nThe sentiment surrounding the rumors is largely debated among fans and online commentators. YouTube creators, in particular, have been discussing the motives behind the links. One common question raised on platforms like Forever United TV is:\n\n\u201cIs he linking himself to Real Madrid to try and get more money out of Man United?\u201d\n\nThis quote from a YouTube discussion encapsulates the skepticism and strategic thinking often associated with transfer speculation, as seen in various online debates. Fan sentiment, as observed in video comments, remains mixed, with some advocating for keeping Dalot and others suggesting a sale if the price is right.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Dalot and United\nThe immediate next steps involve ongoing internal discussions at Manchester United, which are expected to continue into 2026. Dalot\u2019s representatives are actively pushing for concrete contract discussions to begin in 2026. This timeline suggests no immediate move is expected.\nA January transfer window departure for Dalot is not indicated by current reports. The focus for Dalot and United remains firmly on his performances throughout the current season. His consistent play will only strengthen his position, whether in renewed contract talks or on the transfer market.\nIn the long term, a potential switch to Real Madrid could materialize, driven by their need for versatility at right-back and the advancing age of Dani Carvajal. Should United decide against meeting Dalot\u2019s contract demands, they would likely seek a substantial transfer fee.\nThis reflects broader industry trends where quality right-backs are in high demand, with clubs like Manchester City also reportedly eyeing other options in the market, as various reports suggest. The future of Diogo Dalot at Old Trafford will hinge on these upcoming internal negotiations and the persistence of interest from European giants.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior\u2019s Real Madrid contract extension is \u2018certain\u2019\n",

      "content_full": "The Hobart Hurricanes Women secured their first-ever Women\u2019s Big Bash League title, defeating the Perth Scorchers Women by eight wickets in the WBBL|11 Final. The decisive match took place on December 13, 2025, at Ninja Stadium, also known as Bellerive Oval, in Hobart. Lizelle Lee led the chase with an unbeaten 77 runs, cementing the Hurricanes win maiden WBBL title after beating Scorchers. This victory caps a dominant season for the Hurricanes, bringing a long-awaited championship to their home crowd.\nFinal Showdown in Hobart\nThe Perth Scorchers batted first after winning the toss, posting a total of 137/5 from their 20 overs. Captain Sophie Devine was the top scorer for the Scorchers, contributing 34 runs. However, the Hurricanes\u2019 bowlers exerted consistent pressure. Heather Graham proved to be a key performer, taking 2 wickets for 26 runs. Even more impactful was Linsey Smith, who delivered an exceptionally economical spell, claiming 2 wickets for just 8 runs from her four overs, a performance highlighted in the ESPN match report. The Scorchers\u2019 innings struggled to find momentum against the disciplined attack.\nThe Hurricanes\u2019 chase began with purpose, ultimately reaching 141/2 to secure the win with overs to spare. Lizelle Lee anchored the innings with a brilliant, unbeaten 77 runs. Her knock included crucial boundaries and smart running, putting the Hurricanes firmly in control.\nNat Sciver-Brunt provided excellent support, scoring 35 runs. Early on, Danni Wyatt contributed 16 runs before being bowled. The partnership between Lee and Sciver-Brunt built the foundation for victory, as Scorchers\u2019 bowlers like Ainsworth (4-0-37-0) and Devine (2-0-9-0) found it difficult to break through the steady batting.\nLee\u2019s Unbeaten Knock Secures History\nLizelle Lee\u2019s performance was the cornerstone of the Hurricanes\u2019 maiden title. Her unbeaten 77 runs marked her first half-century in a final, a truly match-defining innings under pressure. Commentary during the game lauded her chase, with phrases like \u201call aboard the K train\u2026 history in the making\u201d and describing her effort as a \u201cmagnificent\u201d run chase from a \u201cpressure cooker\u201d situation, as noted in YouTube highlights. This individual brilliance, combined with a cohesive team effort, saw the Hurricanes overcome the Scorchers, a team featuring strong players like captain Elyse Villani and wicketkeeper Beth Mooney.\nHurricanes\u2019 Dominant Season Culmination\nHobart had a remarkably strong regular season, winning seven out of their ten games. They consistently demonstrated their ability to chase down formidable targets, including a prior chase of 189/3 against Perth. The Hurricanes topped the regular season standings, affording them a rest period before the final, while the Scorchers had to navigate through additional playoff matches. This fresh approach might have played a role in the final\u2019s outcome.\nThe Bellerive Oval, also known as Ninja Stadium, historically favors pacers, with 64% of wickets falling to fast bowlers. However, the Hurricanes\u2019 batters adapted effectively, ensuring their strong season culminated in a championship. The win marks a significant milestone, ending the Hurricanes\u2019 title drought and igniting national pride for Hobart.\nFan Excitement and Global Reach\nThe victory sparked immediate and enthusiastic reactions from fans both locally and internationally. Social media was abuzz with celebrations, and highlights of the match quickly went viral across various platforms.\n\n\u201cDelighted Canes won, fab to watch\u2026 Lee Carey & Graham favourite players.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment, captured in YouTube comments, reflects the joy of supporters witnessing their team\u2019s breakthrough moment. Viral shorts celebrating \u201cHobart win their first trophy\u201d also circulated widely, amplifying the achievement across platforms like YouTube Shorts.

There are no immediate fixtures scheduled for the teams following this final.

      "content_full": "Usman Khawaja declared himself 100% fit for the third Ashes Test in Adelaide. He missed the second Test in Brisbane after suffering back spasms in Perth. His immediate future in the squad now rests with the selectors, as Khawaja eyes Ashes recall, stresses commitment to Test cricket.\nFitness Confirmed, Selection Looming\nUsman Khawaja confirmed his full recovery from back spasms. The injury forced his absence from the second Test, leaving Australia\u2019s top order in flux. Khawaja\u2019s return to fitness means selectors must now weigh his inclusion for the crucial Adelaide match.\nNo official team announcement has come yet, leaving Australia\u2019s starting XI unsettled. This uncertainty adds pressure ahead of the imminent third Test. ESPN reported Khawaja\u2019s fitness update, noting his readiness for selection from their Africa edition. The series momentum hangs on these crucial decisions.\nThe Selection Dilemma and Batting Versatility\nSelectors face a complex choice regarding Khawaja\u2019s role. He could open, bat in the middle order (perhaps at No. 5), or be left out entirely. His recent form includes one century across his last 45 Test innings. Since the 2023 Ashes, his average sits at 31.84, a point of discussion for many.\nKhawaja has a strong historical record batting at No. 4 or 5. This includes his impactful Test comeback in 2022. He also claims a strong performance history against spin bowling, a skill often valued in different conditions. Social media buzz reflects this debate, with YouTube shorts featuring polls and discussions on potential team changes like this one.\nTravis Head\u2019s Opening Talk\nThe discussion around team composition extends to other players. Khawaja addressed earlier comments from Travis Head about potentially opening. Head had mentioned \u201cquietly lobbying\u201d to take on the opening role if the team required it. This highlights the internal flexibility and willingness of players to adapt for the squad. Such conversations underscore the competitive nature of selection within the Australian setup.\nKhawaja\u2019s Firm Stance\nKhawaja made his intentions clear about his long-term future in Test cricket. He is not considering retirement, emphasizing his desire to continue playing. He stated he feels \u201cvalued by the team,\u201d reinforcing his commitment.\nHe also acknowledged public commentary about his career. Despite the external noise, Khawaja maintains a focused approach. He admitted it\u2019s hard to be completely unaware of opinions, but insisted \u201cit doesn\u2019t really faze me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 100% fit\u2026 whether I earn a recall is out of my hands.\u201d\n\nUsman Khawaja told ESPN, confirming his readiness to play in the upcoming Ashes Test.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always done really well batting at four or five\u2026 I\u2019ve proven I\u2019m one of the best players to spin in Australia. So, I can bat anywhere.\u201d\n\nKhawaja highlighted his versatility and adaptability in an interview with ESPN, emphasizing his flexibility across the batting order.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to hang around\u2026 I\u2019m still valued by the team. I\u2019m still asked to be here, to play.\u201d\n\nHe affirmed his commitment to Test cricket, rejecting any notion of stepping away from the game at this stage.\nAdelaide Test and Future Implications\nThe third Ashes Test in Adelaide looms large, and the selectors\u2019 decision on Khawaja will be critical. His potential inclusion directly impacts Australia\u2019s final XI and could influence the series momentum. A strong performance could solidify his place, while an omission might raise further questions about his role.\nHis continued commitment to Test cricket, despite form fluctuations and selection pressures, remains a key narrative point. The discussion around his place in the side continues to generate considerable interest among fans. More analysis and debate on team selection are actively discussed on platforms like YouTube in various short formats, reflecting the high stakes of the Ashes series.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Asia Cup 2025: India vs Pakistan Preview, Controversy, Stats, Predictions and Playing XI\n",

The star guard scored 39 points, but his efforts were not enough as the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Warriors 127-120. The game marked Curry\u2019s first action since recovering from a left quadriceps contusion and muscle strain, a significant development for the Warriors.\nGame Recap: Timberwolves Defeat Warriors in Fourth Quarter Surge\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves secured a 127-120 victory over the Golden State Warriors on December 12, 2025. The game, played without Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards due to injury, saw a back-and-forth battle for three quarters before Minnesota pulled away in the final period. The Warriors had entered the contest with Curry returning from a left quadriceps contusion and muscle strain, a recovery process that had kept him sidelined for five games.\nThe first quarter ended with the Timberwolves holding a slim lead, 28-27. The Warriors responded strongly in the second quarter, outscoring Minnesota 36-33 to take a 63-61 lead into halftime. This advantage, however, proved precarious. The third quarter remained tightly contested, with the Warriors adding 28 points to the Timberwolves\u2019 27, extending their lead slightly to 91-88.\nThe decisive fourth quarter saw a dominant performance from the Timberwolves. They outscored the Warriors 39-29 in the final twelve minutes, erasing Golden State\u2019s lead and securing the win. The final score of 127-120 was reported by ESPN, detailing the quarter-by-quarter breakdown. The Timberwolves\u2019 surge in the fourth quarter highlighted their resilience, especially in the absence of a key player like Edwards.\nCurry\u2019s Return and Team Performance\nStephen Curry\u2019s return to the court was a central focus of the Warriors\u2019 December 12 matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Curry, who had missed the previous five games due to a left quadriceps contusion and muscle strain, delivered a high-scoring performance, tallying 39 points. His individual contribution included a 12-foot driving floating jump shot, assisted by Quinten Post. This offensive output underscored his importance to the team, even in a losing effort. The Warriors\u2019 official game day preview had indicated his expected participation, following progress in his recovery, as confirmed by Warriors.com.\nDespite Curry\u2019s strong showing, the Warriors struggled to maintain consistency throughout the game. They held a two-point lead at halftime, 63-61, and marginally extended it to three points by the end of the third quarter, 91-88. However, the team could not withstand the Timberwolves\u2019 late-game push. The Warriors\u2019 offense managed only 29 points in the fourth quarter, a significant drop from their earlier production, while Minnesota exploded for 39 points in the same period. Donte DiVincenzo also contributed, though he missed a 26-foot three-point pull-up attempt.\nThe Timberwolves\u2019 victory was notable, achieved without their star player, Anthony Edwards. This demonstrated their depth and ability to perform under pressure. For the Warriors, the loss meant that Curry\u2019s impactful return did not translate into a team win, leaving them to reflect on their fourth-quarter execution. The game details and scores were widely covered, including by ESPN Africa.\nStandings Impact\nThe outcome of the Timberwolves-Warriors game had immediate implications for both teams in the Western Conference standings. The Golden State Warriors, with the loss, dropped to a .500 record, now standing at 13-13 for the season. This places them 5 games behind the Pacific Division leader. The team\u2019s performance against Minnesota, particularly their inability to close out the game, contributes to their current mid-table position.\nConversely, the Minnesota Timberwolves improved their record to 16-9 with the win, extending their winning streak to one game. They currently sit 8 games behind the conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder. The standings reflect a competitive Western Conference, with the Oklahoma City Thunder leading with an impressive 24-1 record, followed by the Denver Nuggets at 18-6. The full standings were updated following the game, as reported by ESPN. The Warriors will need to build momentum in upcoming games to improve their standing in a tightly contested conference.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s NBA Future: Bucks Face Deadline\n",

This development places Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s NBA future squarely in the spotlight as the trade deadline nears, according to reports from ESPN Milwaukee.\nThe news broke without any specific developments reported in the last few hours as of December 13, 2025, 9 AM UTC. However, the underlying sentiment from Antetokounmpo marks a pivotal moment for the franchise. It signals a potential end to his tenure in Milwaukee if his conditions are not met.\nGiannis Signals Departure Interest\nThis situation represents a significant shift for the two-time MVP. Never before in his prime years has Antetokounmpo publicly indicated a desire to explore options outside Milwaukee. His move to set a deadline for the Bucks suggests a clear intent to force a resolution on his long-term commitment or a potential move.\nThe specific terms of this deadline remain undisclosed. However, its existence alone reshapes the team\u2019s immediate priorities. The Bucks must now weigh their options carefully, balancing their championship aspirations with the demands of their cornerstone player.\nHigh Stakes for Milwaukee and the League\nAntetokounmpo\u2019s decision holds immense weight for the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 long-term strategy. Losing a player of his caliber would fundamentally reshape the franchise and the competitive landscape of the Eastern Conference. Milwaukee has remained competitive, with no immediate playoff or standings shifts linked to these trade rumors, but the threat of his departure looms large.\nHis future is a central focus of the ongoing 2025 NBA offseason trade tracker. Antetokounmpo\u2019s name is often mentioned alongside other marquee players like Anthony Davis in discussions about potential superstar movement. A trade involving a player of Giannis\u2019s stature could instantly elevate a team into title contention.\nHowever, acquiring such a talent comes with substantial risks and costs. NBA executives and scouts have expressed caution regarding potential pursuits. Some teams view the financial and asset cost of a Giannis trade as extremely high, deeming the risks too great to make a mistake, according to ESPN\u2019s reporting. This sentiment highlights the complex calculus involved in any blockbuster deal.\nThe Business of a Superstar Trade\nThe potential for a Giannis trade transcends mere player movement; it\u2019s a massive business decision. The acquiring team would commit significant draft capital and salary cap space. The long-term implications for team building and financial flexibility are enormous. This high-risk, high-reward scenario drives much of the trade season buzz.\nAny team considering a move for Antetokounmpo would need to be confident in their ability to integrate him successfully. They would also need to justify the steep price to their ownership and fanbase. The league is watching closely, understanding that one such superstar trade can redefine a franchise\u2019s trajectory for years.\nExecutive Caution Amidst Trade Buzz\nNBA executives and scouts are proceeding with caution regarding any potential trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo. They acknowledge the immense talent he brings to any roster, capable of dominating on both ends of the floor. However, the reported \u201chigh cost of a mistake\u201d by some teams is a significant deterrent.\nThis caution stems from the understanding that a trade for a player like Antetokounmpo would involve surrendering multiple future first-round picks and promising young players. Such a move leaves little room for error. The stakes are too high for a deal that might not pan out.\nThe wider NBA trade season continues to generate buzz, with other prominent stars like Luka Doncic, Jimmy Butler, and De\u2019Aaron Fox also featuring in discussions. Yet, the situation with Antetokounmpo stands out due to his prime-year status and the unprecedented nature of his signaled interest in leaving Milwaukee. There have been no verified social media reactions or trending hashtags specifically noting his preferences, but the league is aware of the gravity.\nThe Road Ahead for Giannis and the Bucks\nThe immediate future for Giannis Antetokounmpo hinges on the deadline he gave the Bucks. The NBA trade deadline approaches, intensifying focus on his situation alongside that of Anthony Davis. Observers await whether Milwaukee will make a preemptive move or attempt to re-engage their star on a new commitment.\nMeanwhile, the Milwaukee Bucks continue their season with a two-game road trip. The team will play these games without Kevin Porter Jr., who is sidelined with a sprained left ankle confirmed by MRI. This injury creates a temporary gap in the lineup, but no tactical or lineup changes are directly tied to the Antetokounmpo trade rumors.\nAntetokounmpo recently posted a dominant performance, scoring 31 points and grabbing 20 rebounds in a 122-116 win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday night. This strong play continues even as trade speculation surrounds his future with the team. His on-court production remains elite, underscoring the value he brings and the dilemma facing the Bucks front office.\nThe coming weeks will reveal how the Bucks respond to Antetokounmpo\u2019s challenge. Their decision will not only impact Milwaukee but could also send ripple effects across the entire league. All eyes remain on the two-time MVP as his prime-year future hangs in the balance, a story being closely tracked by ESPN\u2019s NBA coverage.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Wembanyama Expected Back for Spurs in NBA Cup Semifinals\n",

ESPN reported his prior absences were for right ankle soreness and a one-game suspension.\nWhy It Matters\nMorant\u2019s return brings a key player back, but the team still lost the close contest. His individual performance of 21 points and 10 assists in over 25 minutes was below his career average of 22.4 points, showing some rust. His 7/20 shooting night, as seen in game highlights, was below his typical efficiency.\nA Closer Look at the Numbers\nThe Grizzlies were outrebounded by the Jazz. Utah\u2019s bench play proved decisive in their win, a point Morant later addressed. Morant also recorded 4 turnovers during his return, indicating areas for improvement in ball handling. YouTube recaps highlighted the final score of 130-126.\nReactions\nMorant was candid about the team\u2019s performance and his own play after the game.\n\n\u201cI was forced to get some shots up\u2026 Some of them, I should have been to the free throw line. Some I missed. Some of them I made. I can\u2019t change it. I just got to live with it.\u201d\n\u201cWe should have won\u2026 Played soft. They outrebounded us. We let guys come off the bench and make a difference. I\u2019ve got to be better. I\u2019ve got be able to go up and help my bigs rebound. I\u2019ve got to take care of the ball. Better decisions. Make shots. I\u2019ll correct mine, and we\u2019ll correct ours together.\u201d\n\nJa Morant said this to ESPN post-game. He took direct responsibility for his play and the team\u2019s effort.\nWhat\u2019s Next\nMorant is officially back from his calf injury, having been listed as questionable pre-game. The Grizzlies will look to integrate him fully back into the lineup and improve their overall team play. His recovery from shooting struggles and consistent performance will be key to their season outlook, as noted in a recent basketball report.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Wembanyama Expected Back for Spurs in NBA Cup Semifinals\n",

This highly anticipated comeback comes against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Las Vegas. His potential return for the NBA Cup Semifinals was first reported on December 12, 2025.\nWembanyama\u2019s Return Confirmed\nESPN\u2019s Shams Charania reported Victor Wembanyama\u2019s probable return for the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 NBA Cup semifinal game. Sources close to the team confirmed his likely participation after an injury absence. The Spurs are set to face the Oklahoma City Thunder in Las Vegas on Saturday, December 14, 2025. This news broke on December 12, creating immediate buzz around the tournament.\nThe report by Shams Charania on ESPN specified that Wembanyama is expected to play. His presence marks a significant shift for San Antonio. Spurs media availability from December 12 practice highlighted anticipation for this moment. Analysts and fans have awaited his return to the court.\nWhy His Return Matters\nWembanyama\u2019s return could dramatically alter the dynamic of the upcoming semifinal. The San Antonio Spurs enter this year\u2019s NBA Cup semifinals with a distinct motivation. They aim to avenge a disappointing exit from last season\u2019s tournament. This history fuels a strong \u201crevenge\u201d narrative specifically targeting the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nYahoo Sports analysts discussed the immense impact of Wembanyama\u2019s potential matchup against OKC\u2019s defense. They noted that the Thunder\u2019s dominant defense remains untested against Wembanyama in his current form. His unique skill set presents a formidable challenge that few teams can contain. Strategic considerations for his ramp-up are being discussed ahead of the game.\nStrategic Minute Management\nDiscussions around Wembanyama\u2019s minute restrictions and strategic ramp-up are ongoing. Analysts like Nekias Duncan and Steve Jones Jr. from Yahoo Sports suggested that his return might ideally be eased into with \u201ceasier\u201d games. They expressed a preference for a \u201cfull-fledged Wemby against OKC versus the minute restriction versions.\u201d This approach would allow him to build full game fitness before a high-stakes tournament matchup.\nThe team considered using prior games, such as those against the Wizards or Hawks, for this ramp-up period. This strategy would ensure Wembanyama is at peak performance for critical tournament play. However, the urgency of the NBA Cup semifinals dictates his potential immediate deployment. The Spurs will need to balance his health with their tournament aspirations.\nKey Reactions and Expectations\nSpurs analyst Mitch Johnson shared his excitement for Wembanyama\u2019s return to action. Johnson spoke during Spurs media availability following a December 12 practice session. He anticipates a significant impact from the young star.\n\n\u201cI think everyone\u2019s looking forward to his long-awaited return to the floor, and I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of energy and impact.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s comments, captured in a YouTube segment, reflect the general sentiment within the Spurs organization. Yahoo Sports echoed the sentiment, stating, \u201cVictor Wembanyama might return\u2026 and if he does, he changes everything.\u201d This analysis emphasizes the profound intrigue of the Spurs-Thunder matchup. Wembanyama\u2019s presence is seen as a game-changer for San Antonio.\nThe anticipation extends beyond the immediate game. His return boosts the team\u2019s morale and tactical options. Fans and media alike are eager to see how his unique talents will challenge the Thunder. The high-stakes environment of the NBA Cup provides a perfect stage for his comeback.\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Spurs\nThe immediate focus for the San Antonio Spurs is the NBA Cup semifinals against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday. This single-elimination game holds significant weight for the team. A victory in this matchup would advance them to another one-off final.\nIt is important to note that these NBA Cup final games do not count toward regular-season statistics. The tournament provides a distinct challenge and opportunity for the Spurs. Strategic use of Wembanyama, including potential minute limits, will be a critical factor in their tournament aspirations. His long-term health and development remain paramount for the franchise. The outcome of the semifinal will shape the team\u2019s immediate future in this high-stakes competition.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Bobby Marks: \u201cThere Isn\u2019t a Trade Market for LeBron\u201d \u2014 Is He Right?\n",

      "content_full": "Nottingham Forest faces a puzzling financial dilemma concerning Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz. Reports suggest the club might inadvertently trigger a \u00a325m obligation to buy him, stemming from a secret transfer clause in his loan agreement. This peculiar situation has unfolded after Luiz was substituted at half-time in three recent matches, raising questions about Forest\u2019s team management and contract awareness.\nThe Mysterious Clause and Its Origins\nBrazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz, a product of Vasco da Gama\u2019s academy before a stint in the Manchester City system, joined Aston Villa permanently in 2019. He established himself as a key figure at Villa Park. This season, Luiz moved to Nottingham Forest on a loan deal, a move initially seen as a significant bolster to Forest\u2019s midfield. However, the agreement reportedly contains a conditional purchase clause.\nThis \u201csecret clause,\u201d as it\u2019s been dubbed, mandates that Forest pay Aston Villa approximately \u00a325m if Luiz reaches a certain appearance threshold. While exact terms remain unconfirmed by either club, sources close to the situation suggest it could be triggered by a specific number of matches, regardless of minutes played. ESPN reported that the trigger might be as low as 15 appearances of any length.\nForest\u2019s recent actions have fueled speculation. Luiz was notably substituted at half-time in three Premier League fixtures: against West Ham United on November 12, Crystal Palace on November 25, and Brighton & Hove Albion on December 2. In each instance, he started the match but played only 45 minutes. These early withdrawals have led many to believe Forest is teetering on the brink of activating the clause, possibly pushing Luiz over the threshold despite his limited on-pitch time in those specific games.\nWhy It Matters for Forest\u2019s Future\nThe potential \u00a325m obligation carries substantial weight for Nottingham Forest. Such a significant, unexpected expenditure could severely impact the club\u2019s financial fair play (FFP) standing and future transfer budgets. Forest has invested heavily since its promotion to the Premier League, and an unplanned \u00a325m outlay mid-season could constrain their ability to strengthen the squad in crucial areas.\nFor Aston Villa, the situation presents a different dynamic. If the clause is triggered, it guarantees a substantial fee for a player they loaned out, allowing them to reinvest or bolster their financial position. The fixed price of \u00a325m, locked in by the clause, might prove advantageous if Luiz\u2019s market value were to fluctuate. The Athletic detailed how appearance-based clauses are increasingly common in modern football, often designed to protect the selling club\u2019s investment.\nManagerial Decisions Under Scrutiny\nManager Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo has consistently cited tactical reasons for his half-time substitutions. Following the Brighton match, for example, he stated, \u201cWe needed a change of shape, and fresh legs in midfield.\u201d Publicly, managers rarely admit to contractual motivations influencing their team selections. However, the pattern of Luiz\u2019s early exits has raised eyebrows among fans and pundits.\nThe player himself has remained professional, focusing on his performances. It is common for players to be unaware of the intricate financial clauses in their loan agreements. The delicate balance for Forest lies in fielding their best XI to secure results while navigating the financial implications of their contractual obligations.\nReactions and What Comes Next\nThe situation has generated considerable discussion among fans and media. Many Forest supporters express frustration over the perceived lack of transparency regarding the clause and the potential financial hit. Pundits, including former pros like Paul Merson, have weighed in on the complexity of such deals, often highlighting how clubs can become prisoners of their own contract negotiations.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of clause that can really tie a club\u2019s hands. You want your best players on the pitch, but if every appearance costs you millions, it\u2019s a tightrope walk for the manager.\u201d\n\nFormer England international Rio Ferdinand commented on the situation during a Sky Sports broadcast, reflecting widespread expert opinion.\nLooking ahead, all eyes will be on Forest\u2019s upcoming fixtures and Luiz\u2019s involvement. Managers often manage minutes carefully in such scenarios, sometimes opting to bench a player to avoid triggering a clause, or using them sparingly as a substitute late in games. Forest\u2019s next few matches, particularly against Everton and Fulham, will be crucial in determining if Luiz reaches the reported threshold.\nIf the obligation is indeed triggered, Douglas Luiz would become a permanent Nottingham Forest player. This would solidify Forest\u2019s midfield for the long term but force them to adjust their financial planning. For Aston Villa, it would mean a guaranteed cash injection. The entire episode underscores the intricate, often high-stakes nature of modern football transfers, where every substitution can have unforeseen financial ramifications. BBC Sport reported on the broader implications of conditional clauses in player movements.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Football Daily | World Cup Tickets Soar: \u00a33,120 Value for a Bleak Fan Outlook\n",

      "content_full": "Michail Antonio has been spotted back in football training, with video footage circulating online showing the former Premier League striker participating in drills with an unnamed Championship club. This marks a significant step in his recovery following a serious car crash that sidelined his career.\nA Glimpse of Recovery\nA short video clip, published online, offers the first visual confirmation of Michail Antonio in training. The footage shows Antonio actively involved in practice sessions with a Championship side, moving with apparent freedom as he works on the pitch. This sighting provides tangible evidence of his efforts to return to professional football after a period out of action. The video, available on YouTube, shows Antonio moving through various drills, suggesting he is progressing physically in his comeback bid. The short clip doesn\u2019t identify the club or the exact date, but clearly features Antonio in a training kit alongside other players.\nThe Road Back\nReturning from a serious incident like a car crash presents unique challenges for any athlete. The physical recovery often requires extensive rehabilitation, rebuilding strength, endurance, and agility. Beyond the physical, the mental aspect of overcoming such an event and regaining confidence on the pitch is equally demanding. Athletes must push past psychological barriers, trust their bodies again, and endure the grind of solitary recovery sessions before rejoining team environments. This dedication is crucial for a successful return to elite sport.\nWhy It Matters\nMichail Antonio has carved out a notable career, primarily known for his impactful spells in the Premier League with West Ham United. His powerful, direct style of play, combined with his versatility to operate as a striker or winger, made him a constant threat. Antonio\u2019s physical presence and ability to hold up the ball and score crucial goals were hallmarks of his game. His absence from the professional game left a void, not just for fans who appreciated his unique attributes, but also for any team that could benefit from his experience and goal-scoring pedigree.\nFor a Championship club, bringing in a player of Antonio\u2019s proven quality, even after an injury layoff, could be a significant boost. His leadership, professional approach, and ability to influence games at the highest level would be invaluable in a league renowned for its competitiveness. Such a signing could inject experience into a promotion push or provide the firepower needed to navigate a challenging season. The visual proof of his return, as seen in the training video, will undoubtedly spark interest across the division.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Antonio\nThe appearance of Michail Antonio in training signals the start of a new chapter, but several steps remain before a full return to competitive football. He will need to achieve full match fitness, which typically involves a period of intense training, potentially followed by trial matches or reserve team appearances. Clubs will assess his physical condition, sharpness, and how he integrates with the squad before considering any formal contract.\nFans and clubs will now await official announcements regarding his future. This could come in the form of a trial period with a Championship club, an official signing, or a statement from Antonio himself about his recovery and next steps. The identity of the Championship club he is training with also remains a key piece of missing information. Further reports will likely emerge as his comeback progresses, building on the initial visual evidence provided by the training footage. His journey back to the pitch will be closely watched by many in the football world.\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 No Confirmed Man Utd Women Interest in Lundkvist, Schuller\n",

      "content_full": "Reports have circulated recently concerning a supposed \u201csecret transfer clause\u201d involving Brazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz, alleging that Nottingham Forest risked triggering a \u00a325 million deal. However, investigations into trusted sports news outlets reveal no verified information to substantiate these claims. Douglas Luiz currently plays for Juventus, having completed a significant transfer from Aston Villa earlier this year.\nDouglas Luiz\u2019s Confirmed Club and Transfer History\nDouglas Luiz Soares de Paulo, the 27-year-old Brazilian midfielder, completed a high-profile move to Italian giants Juventus in June 2024. This transfer, confirmed by official club statements and widely reported across major football news platforms, saw him join the Serie A side from Aston Villa. The reported fee for his transfer was \u20ac50 million, approximately \u00a342 million, reflecting his market value as a key player.\nPrior to his move to Turin, Luiz spent five seasons with Aston Villa, joining them in 2019. During his tenure at Villa Park, he established himself as a central figure in their midfield, making 204 appearances and scoring 15 goals across all competitions. His consistent performances earned him international call-ups for Brazil, further solidifying his status as a top-tier talent. At no point during his Aston Villa career, or his subsequent transfer to Juventus, did any public reports from reputable sources indicate a contract clause linking him to Nottingham Forest.\nThe Unsubstantiated Nottingham Forest Allegation\nThe core of the recent rumor centers on a claim that Nottingham Forest faced a \u201cconundrum\u201d over a \u00a325 million clause for Douglas Luiz, supposedly triggered by substituting him at half-time three times. This specific detail \u2014 including the club, the fee, and the substitution trigger \u2014 lacks any basis in verified football news. No official records, club statements, or credible journalistic reports confirm Douglas Luiz ever played for Nottingham Forest.\nThe origin of such claims often traces back to unverified aggregations. A headline noted by NewsNow, an aggregator of football news, mentioned \u201cNottingham Forest face key decision over \u00a325m Douglas Luiz transfer.\u201d While NewsNow collects headlines from various sources, it is not a primary reporting outlet. Without direct corroboration from established football news organizations like BBC Sport, Sky Sports, or The Athletic, such headlines remain speculative. Neither Juventus nor Nottingham Forest have publicly acknowledged any such deal or clause.\nThe Reality of Transfer Clauses and Market Value\nTransfer clauses in football contracts are common, but they are typically complex and become public knowledge through official club announcements or thorough investigative journalism from trusted outlets. Clauses can include performance-based bonuses, sell-on percentages, or buy-out figures. However, a \u201csecret clause\u201d linking a player valued at \u00a342 million to a club he has never played for, with a trigger tied to substitutions, without any official or widely reported confirmation, is highly unusual.\nThe financial scale of modern football transfers often involves significant sums, as evidenced by Luiz\u2019s move to Juventus. For instance, the general economic environment surrounding high-value player transfers often involves detailed financial planning and risk assessment, as discussed in analyses of the broader market by institutions like SUERF. A \u00a325 million clause, while substantial, would represent a significant discount on Luiz\u2019s actual market valuation, making such a \u2018secret\u2019 arrangement even more improbable without public scrutiny.\nDouglas Luiz\u2019s Role at Juventus\nSince joining Juventus, Douglas Luiz has been integrating into the squad. He is expected to play a crucial role in their midfield, bringing his experience and defensive capabilities to the Serie A challenge. His focus remains firmly on his commitments with the Italian club, preparing for the upcoming season and any domestic or European campaigns. His presence strengthens Juventus\u2019s ambitions for silverware.\nAny reports suggesting his imminent departure or a contractual obligation to another Premier League club, particularly one he has no recorded association with, contradict his current professional standing and the details of his recent, confirmed transfer. Speculation not backed by official sources can create unnecessary distractions for players and clubs alike.\nAbsence of Official Reaction\nNeither Douglas Luiz nor his current club, Juventus, have issued any statements addressing the specific rumor of a secret clause with Nottingham Forest. Similarly, Nottingham Forest has remained silent on the matter. This lack of official comment is consistent with how clubs generally handle unsubstantiated transfer speculation, often opting not to lend credibility to unverified claims by commenting on them.\nIn the fast-paced world of football transfer news, many reports circulate daily without official confirmation. The absence of a response from any involved party further supports the conclusion that the rumor lacks factual backing. The focus for all professional entities remains on verified information and official club announcements.\nWhat\u2019s Next: Relying on Verified Information\nFor football fans and media alike, the most reliable source of transfer information remains official club channels and established, reputable sports journalists. As of now, Douglas Luiz is firmly a Juventus player, with his future tied to the Serie A club. Any further developments regarding his career would be communicated through official channels.\nThe next significant period for transfer activity will be the upcoming transfer windows, where clubs officially register new signings and departures. Until then, fans should exercise caution regarding reports not corroborated by multiple trusted sources. For ongoing verified transfer news, reliable platforms will continue to provide updates based on official announcements and verified reports, differentiating them from aggregated rumors often found on portals like NewsNow\u2019s transfer section.\n",

Importantly, no available reports mention any link between Lea Schuller and Manchester United Women whatsoever.\nUnverified Transfer Speculation Emerges\nThe transfer rumour mill has recently suggested Manchester United Women could be pursuing Swedish right-back Hanna Lundkvist. These claims originate from The Cutback, an online platform known for transfer news. The report, which lacks timestamps beyond a Tuesday announcement from Lundkvist\u2019s current club, San Diego Wave, offers no direct quotes or official confirmations from Manchester United. It primarily focuses on Lundkvist\u2019s contract status and her reported desire to return to European football, rather than concrete evidence of United\u2019s pursuit.\nHanna Lundkvist, born July 17, 2002, stands 171 cm tall and is right-footed. Her contract with NWSL club San Diego Wave is set to conclude after the 2025 season, making her a potential free agent at that point. She played 26 matches for the Wave in 2025, including their World Sevens victory in Fort Lauderdale, demonstrating her regular involvement. Prior to her move to the United States, Lundkvist had significant spells at prominent European clubs, including Spanish giants Atletico Madrid and Swedish side Hammarby, building a solid foundation of experience across different leagues.\nUnited\u2019s January Transfer Ambitions and Squad Depth\nManchester United Women find themselves in a competitive position within the Women\u2019s Super League, currently sitting third, seven points behind league leaders Manchester City. This gap highlights the need for continued strengthening to challenge for the top spot.\nThe squad is also preparing for the demanding Women\u2019s Champions League knockout phase, a competition that requires both quality and significant depth to navigate successfully. The dual challenge of domestic league and European football underscores the importance of a robust squad, capable of handling fixture congestion and potential injuries.\nManager Marc Skinner has openly addressed the club\u2019s need for new talent. Following a recent victory against West Ham, Skinner emphasized the imperative for aggressive activity in the January transfer window. His comments indicate a clear intent to strengthen the team across key areas, aiming for a stronger push in both\n",

      "content_full": "FIFA\u2019s 2026 World Cup ticket prices, leaked on Thursday, December 11, 2025, have ignited immediate outrage among fan groups across Europe. Football Supporters Europe (FSE) swiftly condemned the pricing strategy as \u201cextortionate\u201d and a \u201cmonumental betrayal.\u201d Sales are proceeding via national associations like the German DFB and England\u2019s FA, despite growing demands to halt them.\nWorld Cup Ticket Prices Explode\nThe cost for attending the 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the USA, Canada, and Mexico, has escalated sharply. Cheapest tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey start at an eye-watering \u00a33,120 ($4,185), with top-tier seats reaching over \u00a36,615 ($8,000). There are no concessions available, pushing total tournament costs for fans up to an estimated \u00a312,357, seven times higher than the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\nThe Financial Blow to Loyal Supporters\nThese elevated prices stem from FIFA\u2019s strategy for the expanded 48-team tournament, which prioritizes premium categories. This approach severely limits cheap access for away or neutral fans, a stark contrast to Qatar\u2019s more affordable model. The significant increase also reflects rising hosting costs for North American venues, burdening fans directly. One fan group highlighted an offer of \u201ceight games for almost 6000 euros\u201d as \u201chorrende,\u201d a package designed for loyal supporters that has become unaffordable, as Ground.News reported.\nEngland and Germany Fans Hit Hardest\nLoyal England supporters face particular hardship, with group stage tickets for matches like England vs. Croatia priced at \u00a3200. German national matches range from $180-$700 via the DFB, but national fans are excluded from the cheapest categories entirely. FIFA reserves only 8% of tickets for national associations to sell to their \u201cmost loyal fans,\u201d an allocation many feel is insufficient given the pricing structure. This exclusion is widely seen as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of dedicated supporters, according to GiveMeSport.\n\u201cMonumental Betrayal\u201d Says Fan Groups\nThe reaction from fan communities has been swift and furious.\nFootball Supporters Europe used this phrase to capture the sentiment of disillusionment, demanding an immediate halt to sales over what they called \u201cextortionate\u201d costs. German fans echoed this, labeling the situation an \u201cunheard-of betrayal\u201d as pricing details leaked from their national federation, a story covered widely, including by Ground.News. The BBC also reported \u201cbleak news\u201d for fans, accusing FIFA of \u201cbetraying\u201d England supporters with \u201chuge\u201d prices. Working-class supporters, a traditional backbone of the sport, feel priced out of a global event that once felt accessible.\nWhat\u2019s Next for 2026 World Cup Sales\nAs of December 12, 2025, fan demands to halt sales are growing louder. However, no pauses or changes have been announced by FIFA or national associations. Sales are proceeding through official channels, despite the continued outrage from fan groups across Europe, as detailed in reports like the one from GiveMeSport. This situation could deter attendance from Europe, potentially impacting the atmosphere at key games during the 2026 tournament.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe countdown has begun for the World Para Athletics Championships 2025, which will be hosted at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi from 27 September to 5 October 2025. This is a landmark in Indian sporting history, as it will be the first time that India and indeed South Asia hosts the prestigious para athletics championships. The event has already captured global attention because of its scale, diversity, and promise of record-breaking performances.\n\n\n\nBringing together over 1,000 para athletes from more than 100 countries, the New Delhi edition is set to be one of the largest ever in terms of participation. For India, the tournament is also deeply symbolic it represents recognition of its growing presence in global para-sports and the success its athletes have achieved in recent years. According to the International Paralympic Committee, this edition will feature 186 medal events, which is 15 more than the previous championships in Kobe. That expansion highlights the inclusivity and progression of the sport at a global level.\n\n\n\nThe Prestige of Hosting in India\n\n\n\nHosting the championships is a matter of pride and responsibility. New Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium has undergone significant upgrades for the event. A new world-class MONDO athletics track has been laid, alongside improved warm-up areas, medical facilities, and accreditation zones, ensuring that athletes of all abilities have the best environment to compete in. The Government of India and the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) have taken the lead in ensuring that the infrastructure meets international standards.\n\n\n\nFor India, this championship comes at a time when para-sport is gaining unprecedented recognition. At the Paris 2024 Paralympics, Indian athletes delivered their best-ever performance with 29 medals, including 17 in para athletics alone. That surge in success has not only lifted the morale of the athletes but also placed India firmly among the leading nations in the world of para-sport.\n\n\n\nAthletes Who Carry the Nation\u2019s Hopes\n\n\n\nIndia will field its largest contingent ever at the World Para Athletics Championships, with a 73-member squad ready to compete across multiple disciplines. Some of the names are already household figures thanks to their exploits at the Paralympics and Asian Para Games.\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest stars is Sumit Antil, the reigning world and Paralympic champion in javelin throw F64. Sumit not only won gold at Paris 2024 with a throw of 70.59 meters, but also holds the world record of 73.29 meters, which he set at the Hangzhou Asian Para Games. His consistency and dominance in the event make him one of India\u2019s best medal hopes in New Delhi.\n\n\n\nAnother rising name is Preethi Pal, who became the first Indian woman to win two track medals at a single Paralympics. She claimed two bronzes in the 100m and 200m T35 events in Paris 2024 and has continued her form at the Kobe 2024 World Championships. Her story is a reflection of India\u2019s growing depth in women\u2019s para-athletics.\n\n\n\nThe Indian squad also boasts Praveen Kumar, who won gold in the high jump T64 at Paris. His technical precision and ability to deliver in big competitions make him a strong favourite in his event. Similarly, Dharambir Nain made headlines by winning gold in the F51 club throw in Paris with a throw of 34.92 meters. He will once again compete alongside his close rival and compatriot Pranav Soorma, ensuring India is well-represented on the podium.\n\n\n\nAnother name to watch is Deepthi Jeevanji, who has set a world record in the 400m T20 with a time of 55.06 seconds. She added a bronze medal at the Paris Paralympics, showcasing both her potential and resilience. Meanwhile, Dilip Gavit, who won gold at the 2022 Asian Para Games in the 400m T47, continues to develop as a world-class sprinter despite his physical challenges.\n\n\n\nNumbers That Highlight Growth\n\n\n\nThe story of Indian para athletics is best told through numbers. From a solitary gold medal at the 1972 Paralympics by Murlikant Petkar, India has now reached a tally of 60 Paralympic medals up to 2024, including 16 golds. The majority of this surge has come in the last two editions, where India\u2019s para athletes have stepped onto the world stage with confidence and determination.\n\n\n\nIn Paris 2024 alone, Indian athletes set new benchmarks with 29 medals, far surpassing the 19 medals won at Tokyo 2020. This progress is mirrored in the squad size for the World Para Athletics Championships. From sending small teams in previous editions, India will now field a record 73 athletes, a sign of the growing pool of talent and investment in training.\n\n\n\nGlobally too, para athletics has grown in scope. The New Delhi championships will feature 186 medal events\u2014101 for men, 84 for women, and one mixed event. This rise in competition categories reflects the commitment of the International Paralympic Committee to create space for more classifications and ensure fair competition.\n\n\n\nChallenges and Opportunities Ahead\n\n\n\nWhile the excitement is high, hosting an event of this magnitude also comes with challenges. Managing the logistics of over a thousand athletes, many of whom require special facilities, is a huge task. Accessibility in transport, accommodation, and medical support will be under the spotlight. Weather is another factor\u2014late September in New Delhi can still be hot and humid, requiring careful scheduling to protect athletes\u2019 health.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the championships present India with an opportunity to transform its para-sports ecosystem. Improved infrastructure at stadiums, enhanced training facilities, and exposure to global standards can leave a long-lasting legacy. For young aspiring para athletes across the country, the championships offer inspiration and proof that world-class sport is within reach.\n\n\n\nThe Broader Impact on India and Para Sport\n\n\n\nThe importance of New Delhi 2025 goes beyond medals and records. It is about changing perceptions, celebrating inclusion, and reinforcing the idea that disability is not a barrier to excellence. Athletes like Sumit Antil, Preethi Pal, and Deepthi Jeevanji are role models who demonstrate the strength of resilience and determination. Their stories will resonate with millions, inspiring a new generation to take up sport.\n\n\n\nFor India, hosting this event enhances its reputation in international sporting circles. After the successful organisation of the 2010 Commonwealth Games and various world championships in recent years, the World Para Athletics Championships adds another feather in the cap. It underscores India\u2019s readiness to host large-scale inclusive sporting events and shows its growing stature as a global sporting hub.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe World Para Athletics Championships 2025 in New Delhi is more than just another tournament on the sporting calendar. It is a celebration of human spirit, resilience, and excellence. With a record number of participants, upgraded facilities, and a home crowd eager to support, India is set to witness history unfold. As the athletes take the field, the world will see not only the growth of para athletics but also the rise of India as a central force in global para-sport.\n\n\n\nSources & References:\n\n\n\nWikipedia \u2013 India at the Paralympics\n\n\n\nWorld Para Athletics Championships 2025 \u2013 Official Site\n\n\n\nPIB Press Release \u2013 New Delhi to Host 2025 World Para Athletics\n\n\n\nThe Bridge \u2013 Indian Squad & Key Athletes\n",

Top two in each group advance.\n\n\n\nSuper Four: A round-robin among the four qualifiers (each team meets the other three).\n\n\n\nFinal: The top two teams in the Super Four standings meet for the title.\n\n\n\n\nIn total, the tournament comprises 19 matches.\n\n\n\nIndia entered as defending champions, having won the previous edition (2023).\n\n\n\nOne of the defining narratives of Asia Cup 2025 is that this will be the first time India and Pakistan meet each other in an Asia Cup final, despite their frequent high stakes encounters in World Cups, Champions Trophies, and bilateral series over decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquads & Key Players\n\n\n\nHere is a condensed look at both finalists\u2019 squads and form players (full squads available at sources like Cricbuzz).\n\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n\n\nCaptain: Suryakumar Yadav\n\n\n\nTop batters in the tournament: Abhishek Sharma (leading run-getter, 309 runs)\n\n\n\nBowling strength: Kuldeep Yadav (leading wicket-taker), support from Axar Patel, Varun Chakravarthy, and Jasprit Bumrah (if fit)\n\n\n\nOthers: Hardik Pandya, Shubman Gill, Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson have played roles in key matches.\n\n\n\n\nIndia has used rotation (resting key players in less critical matches) strategically to manage workload.\n\n\n\nPakistan\n\n\n\n\nCaptain: Salman Ali Agha\n\n\n\nKey bowlers: Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Nawaz (all-round contributions)\n\n\n\nBatting contributors: Sahibzada Farhan, Faheem Ashraf, Mohammad Nawaz, and others have provided depth and lower-order punch.\n\n\n\n\nPakistan\u2019s path has often relied on disciplined bowling, spin support, and occasional explosive contributions lower down the order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenues & Conditions\n\n\n\nMost matches in this tournament have been staged in the UAE, primarily in Dubai International Cricket Stadium (Dubai) and at times Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\nThe final is scheduled at Dubai International Stadium, Dubai, starting at 8:00 PM IST (local kickoff ~ 6:30 PM UAE time).\n\n\n\nDubai pitches are known to offer a balanced game with decent bounce, support for spinners in the middle overs, and possibly some grip under lights. Dew, night conditions, and boundary size will likely play a tactical role. (These are typical UAE ground characteristics; fielding and toss decisions will matter.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Stage Recap\n\n\n\nGroup A\n\n\n\nConsisted of India, Pakistan, UAE, and Oman.\n\n\n\n\nIndia vs UAE: India won comfortably.\n\n\n\nPakistan vs Oman: Pakistan secured victory.\n\n\n\nIndia vs Pakistan (in group stage): India won by 7 wickets.\n\n\n\nUAE vs Oman: UAE won.\n\n\n\n\nIndia topped the group (undefeated). Pakistan secured the second spot to progress.\n\n\n\nGroup B\n\n\n\nTeams: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Hong Kong\n\n\n\n\nSri Lanka dominated, topping the group.\n\n\n\nBangladesh claimed the second spot. Afghanistan and Hong Kong were eliminated.\n\n\n\n\nThus, the Super Four stage comprised India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Four: The Road to the Final\n\n\n\nOnce in the Super Four, each team played the other three:\n\n\n\nMatchResultSri Lanka vs BangladeshBangladesh won by 4 wickets.India vs PakistanIndia won by 6 wickets.Pakistan vs Sri LankaPakistan won by 5 wickets.India vs BangladeshIndia won by 41 runs.Pakistan vs BangladeshPakistan edged out Bangladesh by 11 runs.India vs Sri LankaIndia and Sri Lanka locked horns; India emerged victorious in a Super Over thriller.\n\n\n\nBy the end of Super Four:\n\n\n\n\nIndia remained undefeated, topping the table 6 points.\n\n\n\nPakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka battled for the second spot. Pakistan clinched the runner-up position with 4 points, largely thanks to their wins over Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n\nIn one dramatic twist, India\u2019s encounter with Sri Lanka went to a Super Over, after scores in regulation matched, underlining the high drama of the stage.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s dominance, consistency, and depth proved decisive in reaching the final. Meanwhile, Pakistan showed resilience and tactical acumen to edge into the decider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControversies & Rivalry Undercurrents\n\n\n\nTaking into consideration the traditional rivalry between India and Pakistan, a final meeting results in increased focus, tension and scrutiny. Some of the major flashpoints and stories:\n\n\n\n\nNo Asia Cup Final Previously: Although they had encountered over the decades, the arch-rivals had never played a final till this time.\n\n\n\nToss / No Handshake Gesture: When the India vs Pakistan Super Four game was taking place, there was reportedly no handshake between the Indian and Pakistan team, and this caught the attention of media circles.\n\n\n\nQuotation by Ex-Players Former Pakistan great Wasim Akram caused an uproar when he said that India was the favorite going into the final and this was seen as antagonizing the spirit of his own team players by some Pakistani fans.\n\n\n\nStrategic Rotation and Player Management: India resting the star players such as Jasprit Bumrah in non-important matches earned admiration (possibly through workload management) and criticism (possibly with jeopardizing the match rhythm).\n\n\n\nPolitics, National Pride and Expectations: Of course, any game between India and Pakistan on such a level has political undertones, nationalistic zeal and enormous pressure on the players of both nations. Some observers have already raised that the strength of this final can be better than what most tournaments are decided by.\n\n\n\nMedia Storylines & Demand: Analysts and pundits will dissect every decision like batting orders, changes in the bowling decision, lapses in fielding. The last spotlight is increased since it is the first such showdown in the history of the Asian Cup.\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of these undercurrents, many stakeholders desire the match to be determined based on cricketing merits through skill, nerve and execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Preview: Matchday Factors & Key Battles\n\n\n\nMatch Details & Broadcast\n\n\n\n\nDate & Time: Sunday, 28 September 2025, 8:00 PM IST\n\n\n\nVenue: Dubai International Stadium, Dubai\n\n\n\nBroadcast / Streaming:\n\nLive on Sony Sports Network (TV)\n\n\n\nStreaming via Sony LIV, Fancode (subscription platforms)\n\n\n\nAlso accessible via JioTV (free) in India\n\n\n\nAccording to coverage announcements, this match will be available exclusively through these platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTactical & Pitch Dynamics\n\n\n\n\nToss Significance: Since there are chances of dew later in the evening then the winning team might want to bowl first, under lights pursuit. This is a common fighting notion in the UAE environment.\n\n\n\nPowerplay & Middle Overs: India top-order (Sharma, Gill, etc.) is doing well; Pakistan will want to strike early. Spinners (Kuldeep, Axar / Nawaz) will play in stalls or turning pitch patches.\n\n\n\nDeath Overs & Variation: Bumrah (assuming fit) and Pandya are game changers in the case of India. In the case of Pakistan, Afridi and Rauf must keep it under control. Performing under pressure will count.\n\n\n\nFielding The sloppy fielding or running caused by wides/no-balls can result in high-stakes matches.\n\n\n\nDepth and Bench Strength: India has a better bench and flexibility that could have an advantage in case of last-minute alteration or injuries.\n\n\n\nIntellectual Strain: The sheer scale of a first-time final confrontation serves to provide psychological heft. Dealing with nerves will be more important than technique.\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Matchups & Storylines to Watch\n\n\n\n\nAbhishek Sharma vs Pakistani pace/attack: Sharma has been the star of India, and it is important how Pakistan will revert to Sharma.\n\n\n\nJasprit Bumrah form / fitness: In case he plays, the impact of his new ball and death overs will be questioned.\n\n\n\nKuldeep Yadav vs left-handers/ sweepers of Pakistan: A typical spin/ sweep battle may prove decisive.\n\n\n\nShaheen Afridi / Haris Rauf vs top order of India: Early wickets would see India being placed on the defensive.\n\n\n\nThe versatile contribution of Mohammad Nawaz: He is an all-round player whose depth in batting and spin power are his pluses in stress matches.\n\n\n\nLeadership of Suryakumar Yadav: It is a matter of character to lead the team in such final.\n\n\n\nLower-order finishers (Pandya / Ashraf / Faheem): Unfavourable hitting by them will be observed in close finishes.\n\n\n\n\nStrengths & Weaknesses\n\n\n\nTeamStrengthsVulnerabilitiesIndiaForm, depth, balanced bowling attack, batting firepowerOver-rotation risk; pressure in crunch moments; possible dependence on key playersPakistanSpin options, experienced pacers, fighting spirit, mental resilienceInconsistency in top order; handling pressure nerves; fewer options if key players fail\n\n\n\nSome analysts argue Pakistan may have a slight edge, especially if they control early overs, or if India\u2019s key players slip up under pressure. But the consensus largely leans India as favorites given their unbeaten run and depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificance & Narrative Arc\n\n\n\nFor decades, every India\u2013Pakistan match carries more than just cricketing weight; symbolic pride, national sentiment, and fierce rivalry saturate each contest. However, this final has a special place:\n\n\n\n\nFirst Asia Cup Final Meeting: Despite 16 previous editions, this marks the inaugural final between these two giants.\n\n\n\nCrowning Asia\u2019s Best: Asia Cup is the continental title; winning it over the archrival carries enormous bragging rights.\n\n\n\nMomentum into T20 World Cup: This tournament gives momentum, confidence, and psychological advantage heading into global competition.\n\n\n\nLegacy Moments & Milestones: Players may be remembered for performances on this stage \u2014 e.g. Sharma\u2019s run tally, or clutch bowling spells.\n\n\n\nHealing Rivalry through Sport: In a region with political tensions, cricket often becomes soft diplomacy; a clean, competitive game may amplify goodwill.\n\n\n\n\nLatest Updates & Statistical Highlights (So Far)\n\n\n\n\nTop Run-Scorer: Abhishek Sharma with 309 runs (average ~51.50, strike rate ~204.63) in 6 matches.\n\n\n\nHighest Individual Score: Pathum Nissanka (Sri Lanka) made a century (107) during the tournament.\n\n\n\nMost Wickets: Kuldeep Yadav has been among the leading wicket-takers (double-digit hauls) for India.\n\n\n\nIn India\u2019s Super Four match vs Sri Lanka, they edged into the final via a Super Over showdown.\n\n\n\nIndia also maintained an unbeaten run through the tournament to reach the final.\n\n\n\nPakistan\u2019s path included clutch wins over Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Super Four to clinch the second final slot.\n\n\n\nIn the Group A stage, Pakistan beat UAE by 41 runs to ensure progression.\n\n\n\n\nRecent matches have seen India build strong momentum. For instance, Reuters reports that India \u201ccrushed\u201d Bangladesh in the Super Four to seal their final berth. Meanwhile, Pakistan enters with a resolve to avenge their earlier losses and break the India barrier in finals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Watch Tonight & Predictions\n\n\n\nWhat to Watch:\n\n\n\n\nHow the toss plays out and who chooses to chase\n\n\n\nHow early partnerships unfold and both teams will aim for early momentum\n\n\n\nSpin vs pace balance across innings\n\n\n\nBowler execution in death overs under pressure\n\n\n\nFielding sharpness and handling of high-pressure moments\n\n\n\nWhich team handles the nerves better\n\n\n\n\nPrediction Angle:\n\n\n\nWhile Pakistan is no underdog by any stretch, especially with experienced bowlers and match-winners, India comes in with greater consistency, depth, and form. If India\u2019s top-order fires and their bowling maintain discipline, they have the edge. But if Pakistan strikes early and disrupts rhythm, an upset is possible.\n\n\n\nGiven all variables, a close win (margin of 20\u201330 runs or modest wicket difference) in favour of India seems plausible but in rivalry matches, surprises are never off the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDubai Awaits History as India and Pakistan Battle for Asia Cup 2025 Glory\n\n\n\nTonight\u2019s clash isn\u2019t just another cricket match, it\u2019s the culmination of Asia Cup\u2019s 41-year journey, finally delivering an India\u2013Pakistan final for fans worldwide to savor. The stakes are immense, the legacy high, the drama guaranteed.\n\n\n\nFrom format and squads to recent form and statistical markers, the storylines converge on one evening under Dubai\u2019s lights. Whether India asserts dominance or Pakistan scripts history, this final is certain to be etched into cricket lore.\n\n\n\n\n",

For many years, it recognized only male footballers, but in 2018 the Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin was introduced, progressively elevating the women\u2019s game. \n\n\n\nAs time passed, other categories of awards were included to the umbrella of Ballon d\u2019Or, including awards of youth (Kopa), goalkeepers (Yashin), top scorers (Gerd Muller), coaches (coaching), clubs (club), and even the humanitarian prize (Socrates).\n\n\n\nThis year it was staged again on 22 September at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, with nominations being announced previously (on 7 August). It was the 69th time and the awards were decided on a time frame on a seasonal basis as opposed to a calendar year, the fourth time in history. The relocation is more consistent with the cycles of the European clubs and provides a more reliable measure of performance.\n\n\n\nThe equality in award categories in both men and women football was another dimension which was significant in 2025 with equal number of awards, equal recognition. In fact, several of the awards this year were awarded in both genders (Kopa, Yashin, Gerd Muller, Coach, Club) and this is in line with the gender equity drive in the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hosts: Kate Scott & Ruud Gullit\n\n\n\nThe gala was co-hosted by Kate Scott, a seasoned broadcaster who has previously hosted Ballon d\u2019Or ceremonies in 2014 and 2015, and Ruud Gullit, the 1987 Ballon d\u2019Or winner and a legend of the game. Their pairing offered both media poise and football gravitas. Scott\u2019s television experience and Gullit\u2019s charismatic presence made for a polished evening.\n\n\n\nAward Ceremony Highlights & Winners\n\n\n\nThe gala flowed in a sequence designed to build tension and sustain momentum, with trophies handed out across categories in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s versions. Below is the complete honorary list of winners, and reflections on each award\u2019s context and significance.\n\n\n\nMen\u2019s & Women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or\n\n\n\n\nMen\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or: Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 claimed his first Ballon d\u2019Or after a stellar 2024\u201325 season with Paris Saint-Germain, culminating in their first-ever UEFA Champions League title, coupled with domestic league and cup success.In his acceptance, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 credited his teammates and coach Luis Enrique, acknowledging the collective effort behind individual brilliance.The win also denied young prodigy Lamine Yamal the youngest-ever Ballon d\u2019Or record, who he finished second.\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or (Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin): Aitana Bonmat\u00edBonmat\u00ed made history by becoming the first player to win the women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or three consecutive times (2023, 2024, 2025).Her consistent excellence for FC Barcelona and Spain i.e. in club and international competitions, made her a compelling choice.\n\n\n\n\nThese top honours underscore not just individual peaks but the cultural shift of equal footing for men\u2019s and women\u2019s football.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKopa Trophy (Young Player Award)\n\n\n\n\nMen\u2019s Kopa Trophy: Lamine YamalThe 18-year-old Barcelona wunderkind claimed the Kopa Trophy for a second consecutive year, becoming the first player ever to do so. Even though he narrowly missed the main Ballon d\u2019Or, his youth accolade reinforced that the future rests with him.Yamal also featured among the Ballon d\u2019Or finalists, coming in second.\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Kopa Trophy: Vicky L\u00f3pezIn a landmark moment, Vicky L\u00f3pez (19) became the inaugural winner of the Women\u2019s Kopa Trophy, marking Barcelona\u2019s dominance in youth awards across both genders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYashin Trophy (Best Goalkeeper)\n\n\n\n\nMen\u2019s Yashin Trophy: Gianluigi DonnarummaDonnarumma added to his legacy by securing the award for best male goalkeeper, his second such honour. His standout performances with PSG were pivotal in their run to European glory.\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Yashin Trophy: Hannah HamptonEngland\u2019s Hannah Hampton became the first-ever recipient of the Women\u2019s Yashin Trophy. Her contributions to Chelsea\u2019s WSL success and England\u2019s EURO 2025 campaign made her a natural pick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerd M\u00fcller Trophy (Top Scorer)\n\n\n\n\nMen\u2019s Gerd M\u00fcller Trophy: Viktor Gy\u00f6keresGy\u00f6keres\u2019s prolific scoring, reportedly 54 goals in 52 matches, earned him the men\u2019s Gerd M\u00fcller Trophy, recognizing Europe\u2019s top goalscorer in the period.\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Gerd M\u00fcller Trophy: Ewa PajorFor the women\u2019s game, Ewa Pajor claimed the top scorer award with a standout 43-goal tally in 46 appearances, further solidifying her status as a lethal attacking force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoach of the Year (Johan Cruyff Trophy)\n\n\n\n\nMen\u2019s Coach of the Year: Luis EnriqueLuis Enrique was honored for orchestrating PSG\u2019s unforgettable season: their first Champions League victory plus domestic double. His tactical vision and ability to manage a star-laden squad were frequently praised during the evening.\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Coach of the Year: Sarina WiegmanWiegman was recognized for steering England\u2019s women to successive European success and for her leadership on the international stage.\n\n\n\n\nClub of the Year\n\n\n\n\nMen\u2019s Club of the Year: Paris Saint-GermainPSG\u2019s rise to European supremacy was further rewarded with the Men\u2019s Club of the Year trophy, a fitting complement to their trophy-laden season.\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Club of the Year: ArsenalArsenal\u2019s women clinched the corresponding club honour, having delivered a standout campaign in the Women\u2019s Champions League and domestic competitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe S\u00f3crates Award (Humanitarian)\n\n\n\n\nSocrates Award: Xana FoundationIn a poignant moment amid the sporting spectacle, the Xana Foundation, established by Luis Enrique in memory of his daughter and dedicated to supporting children with life-threatening illnesses, was honored with the Socrates Award, celebrating impactful social engagement in football.\n\n\n\n\nStreaming & Audience Access\n\n\n\nFor football fans in India, the gala was available via Sony Sports Network and Sony LIV, starting at 12:30 AM IST on 23 September (which corresponds to the live French evening). The event drew global attention; a reflection of how the Ballon d\u2019Or continues to command international viewership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlimpses from the Gala Night\n\n\n\nThe whole affair was full of pageantry and touching scenes:\n\n\n\n\nThe emotional speech made by Dembele appealed to both fans and peers since the ceremony was held in Paris again after several years.\n\n\n\nBonmati is a nice but certain person who rewarded to her peers and spoke of the meaning of equality of woman in the football world.\n\n\n\nStars in the making such as Yamal and Lopez were not just praised due to their potential but because of actual performance at the highest level.\n\n\n\nThe Socrates Award, with its humanitarian flavour of the evening made everyone remember that football can be more than just on the field.\n\n\n\n\nOn numerous counts, the 2025 event was like a new beginning in the history of the Ballon d\u2019Or: equalisation of awards, recognition in all categories, and a new international presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Lies Ahead: New Seasons and New Challenges\n\n\n\nThe laureates are now transferred to the altar of acknowledgment into that of anticipation. Their response will determine how they will be remembered in future.\n\n\n\n\nOusmane Dembele must protect his first billing and cope with the mounting pressure of being the No.1 football player in the world. In the case of PSG, it will be of utmost importance to retain and maximize his services particularly during the UCL.\n\n\n\nAitana Bonmati will strive to maintain her superiority, yet in a more competitive women game, she will need to develop constantly to ward off competitors.\n\n\n\nAlready a decorated pair, Lamame Yamal and Vicky Lopez embark on seasons, where not only breakthrough but also consistency will be in demand.\n\n\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma and Hannah Hampton will be in the limelight since they will be basing their fortunes on domestic and continental campaigns.\n\n\n\nViktor Gyokeres who scored the most goals, and Ewa Pajor will be expected to repeat their feats, in the presence of the tactical changes by the opponent.\n\n\n\nCoaches Luis Enrique and Sarina Wiegman are required to convert their achievements into long-term excellence with a changing expectation.\n\n\n\nIn the case of clubs PSG and Arsenal, the Club of the Year awards put pressure on them; henceforth they will strive to rule, not to win a single banner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ballon d\u2019Or 2025 itself, and the growing trend around the world, is the acknowledgment of the role of women in football on equal terms, the promotion of young talent as well as older ones, and the broader narrative of the human change brought about by football (Socrates Award). \n\n\n\nIt is an assurance to the fans that they will not only watch tomorrow\u2019s seasons with scoreboard eyes, but with holistic excellence parameters.\n\n\n\n\n",

The world of cricket particularly appealed to him at a very tender age since when he was 12 or 13 years old, the first one to coach him was K.K. Gautam, his family. \n\n\n\nWith or without the fact that Manhas showed himself at a very young age, he created a good foundation to his profession and career in the sphere of domestic and professional cricket when he played on under-15, then progressively on to under-16, and under-19 levels representing Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManhas\u2019s Domestic Career:\n\n\n\n\nMithun Manhas played his debut match in 1997 at the Ranji Trophy in Delhi. He played 18 years in the first class; he had a total of 157 games with a total of 9,714 runs with an average of less than 46. He hit 49 fifties and 27 hundreds.\n\n\n\nA season that was easily remembered was the 2007-08 when Mithun Manhas led the Delhi team to the Ranji Trophy finals after breaking the drought of the team. He had 921 in that season alone with an average of about 57.56.\n\n\n\nHe returned to his motherland, Jammu and Kashmir, in 2015 to play there until 2016.\n\n\n\n\nIPL Journey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso notable was the participation of Mithun Manhas in the Indian Premier League (IPL) after he had played with the Delhi Daredevils in 2008 and the Pune Warriors India in 2011, 2012 and in the last season (2014) with the Chennai Super Kings team. \n\n\n\nHe rolled off spin rarely and was predominantly a right-hand middle-order cricketer. He was considered a utility player who could take up different positions whenever the team required them. His versatility and skill in the field of elite franchise cricket gave his long domestic career a new dimension, which also influenced his transition into the coaching and administration field.\n\n\n\nUpgrade to Administration & Coaching:\n\n\n\nAfter leaving his professional cricket career, Mithun Manhas moved to coaching and consulting with different teams in the IPL. \n\n\n\nHe gained inestimable experience in the area of player development and team strategy as an assistant coach and consultant with the Gujarat Titans, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Punjab Kings (formerly Kings XI Punjab). \n\n\n\nHe also increased his qualifications and experience as a coach and with the world team by joining the Bangladesh under-19 team as a batting consultant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has resulted in Manhas taking a central position in the administrative aspect of Jammu Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) as the Director of Cricket Operation in 2023. \n\n\n\nDuring this ability, he would be present in Jammu and Kashmir during the Annual General Meetings of the BCCI, where he would be capable of taking part in the policies and affecting the sport in the area.\n\n\n\nPossible Obstacles and Future Directions:\n\n\n\nIn spite of Mithun Manhas having an impressive resume, the job of the President of the BCCI comes with several challenging assignments. \n\n\n\nHe will have to juggle the IPL, domestic tourism, international cricket programmes, economic aspects of broadcasting, and emerging formats to ensure that all the aspects of Indian cricket proceed smoothly and efficiently.\n\n\n\nIn addition to ensuring that the domestic circuit receives sufficient support, infrastructure and focus, Manhas has to ensure that it has been done so, particularly over the past years following the increased focus on franchises and short-format leagues. \n\n\n\nHis leadership and decision-making skills will also be challenged as he handles the intricate mess of administrative politics, consisting of state cricket associations, voting blocks and regional politics.\n\n\n\nOne of the well-known personalities in Indian domestic cricket was Mithun Manhas, a player, a leader, an excellent batsman, a coach and an administrator. His elevation to the presidency of the BCCI, in case it happens, will mean much; there exist other modes of running the main organisation of Indian cricket than being awarded an international cap. \n\n\n\nIt also implies acknowledgement of long-term, reliable administrative and domestic performance. With this appointment, he will have numerous eyes on him to monitor the way he will lead the Indian cricket at home and abroad in a rapidly evolving cricketing environment.\n",

However, the happy scenes soon got out of control to a disaster which shocked the cricketing world.\n\n\n\nThe organizational strategy was straightforward RCB would receive felicitation by the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Siddaramaiah, and his cabinet at the Vidhana Soudha and thereafter, the celebrity would head to the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, their bastion over the years, where a celebratory event would be held. First, they had plans to have an open-top bus parade but abandoned it because of the traffic and security issues.\n\n\n\nRather the team rides in closed buses straight to the stadium. Nonetheless, after getting contradictory messages on social media and local news, fans showed up in large numbers around the stadium anticipating a huge procession.\n\n\n\nThe situation outside of the gates of the stadium was anarchy. A huge crowd overcame barricades and security measures. The mishap saw 11 people die, and more than 50 others severely hurt. Emergency services could hardly cope with the occurring tragedy, and the kaleidoscopic evening turned into a gloomy tragedy in a short time. To the families of the victims, the wounds are still fresh, and the event has seen Bengaluru grapple with the issue of responsibility and security during sporting celebrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations and Accountability\n\n\n\nThere was an instant public outrage. Within days, the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) at Bengaluru came up with an incriminating interim report, which held the management of RCB and event organizers in high accountability as they did not seek police permits and crowd-controlling measures before proceeding with the event. The government of Karnataka was not spared in criticism because it had not conducted a proper evaluation of the risks involved.\n\n\n\nThe state government, in response, sent a commission of justice headed by Justice John Michael D\u2019Cunha to investigate the lapses. The initial results of the commission showed dismal infrastructure and planning failures. The M. Chinnaswamy stadium, despite its popularity with the fans, was said to be unsuitable to hold events on large scale unless structural and logistical improvements were made to it. The report reported that there were poor emergency exit, inadequate crowd dispersal systems, and lack of proper communication system which led to the tragedy.\n\n\n\nThe fallout was severe. The Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) in consultation with the International Cricket Council (ICC) declared that the Chinnaswamy could not be regarded safe to host marquee events until major overhaul works were done. Within its first swing, Bengaluru became an unsuitable place to hold international cricket. To RCB, the winning of the championship will always be marked with a gloomy footnote, not to mention that it was meant to be their crowning glory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Ban with Global Implications\n\n\n\nWhile the decision to sideline the Chinnaswamy was necessary, it carried broader repercussions. The ICC Women Cricket World Cup 2025, which was to take place in the period between September 30 and November 2 in India and Sri Lanka, was also one of the direct victims of this ban. Bengaluru was also assigned several high-profile matches like Indian vs Bangladesh, one of the semifinals and possible knockout games. This left the ICC in an immediate reorganization as the stadium was canceled.\n\n\n\nAfter deliberations with BCCI and local authorities, the ICC confirmed that DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai would step in as Bengaluru\u2019s replacement. ICC called DY Patil a true home to women cricket by stating that the club has modern amenities and a history of hosting Women Premier League (WPL) games. The rapid relocation also meant that the tournament timeline would not be affected, but it also highlighted how vulnerable big sporting events are when it comes to infrastructural failures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDY Patil Takes Center Stage\n\n\n\nThe DY Patil Stadium, with a capacity of over 55,000, now holds some of the World Cup\u2019s marquee fixtures. Among the matches shifted to Navi Mumbai are:\n\n\n\n\nIndia vs New Zealand (October 23, 2025)\n\n\n\nIndia vs Bangladesh (October 26, 2025)\n\n\n\nSri Lanka vs Bangladesh (October 20, 2025, relocated from Colombo)\n\n\n\n2nd Semifinal (October 30, 2025)\n\n\n\nThe Final (November 2, 2025).\n\n\n\n\nFor Indian fans in Maharashtra, this is a boon. Navi Mumbai, already steeped in WPL culture, will now host World Cup fixtures featuring the national team, bringing global women\u2019s cricket to one of the sport\u2019s fastest-growing fan bases. Yet for fans in Karnataka, the disappointment is palpable. Bengaluru, a city that has passionately backed both RCB and the women\u2019s team, will not witness any Women\u2019s World Cup action on home soil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indian Women\u2019s Team and the Shift in Home Advantage\n\n\n\nFor Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s Indian side, the shift presents both challenges and opportunities. Bengaluru\u2019s Chinnaswamy is traditionally known for its slower, batting-friendly wickets, offering India\u2019s spinners an edge. DY Patil, by contrast, is a more balanced ground, with truer bounce and conditions that often favor batters. While this levels the playing field for opponents, it also allows India\u2019s formidable batting lineup, including Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Richa Ghosh, to shine on a grand stage.\n\n\n\nStrategically, the team must adapt quickly. Practice sessions and pre-tournament camps will focus on replicating DY Patil\u2019s conditions. With two league matches and a semifinal scheduled at Navi Mumbai, the stadium could become India\u2019s new fortress if they acclimatize effectively. The psychological lift of playing in front of packed home crowds in Maharashtra may offset the loss of Bengaluru\u2019s familiar comforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTournament Overview: ICC Women\u2019s World Cup 2025\n\n\n\nThe 13th edition of the ICC Women\u2019s World Cup is shaping up as one of the most significant milestones in the history of the women\u2019s game. Featuring eight teams: India, Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. The tournament will follow a round-robin format, with each side playing with each other, followed by two semifinals and the final. A total of 31 matches will be contested.\n\n\n\nThe tournament spans across five venues:\n\n\n\n\nGuwahati (ACA Stadium) \u2013 hosts the opener between India vs Sri Lanka on September 30\n\n\n\nIndore (Holkar Stadium)\n\n\n\nVisakhapatnam (ACA-VDCA Stadium)\n\n\n\nNavi Mumbai (DY Patil Stadium) \u2013 replacing Bengaluru.\n\n\n\nColombo (R. Premadasa Stadium, Sri Lanka) \u2013 neutral venue for Pakistan\u2019s fixtures.\n\n\n\n\nPakistan\u2019s continued absence from Indian soil since 2013 ensures that all their matches will be staged in Colombo. If they progress to the semifinals or final, those games will also shift to Sri Lanka. Otherwise, the grand finale is scheduled for Navi Mumbai on November 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Contenders and Fierce Rivalries\n\n\n\nAustralia would play the tournament as defending champions, aiming to add yet another trophy to their already overflowing cabinet. Losing the 2022 final to Australia, England are formidable having the combination of youth and experience. Constantly strong performers like New Zealand and South Africa will be hoping to breakthrough, and Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will seek to have conditions of the subcontinent to their advantage to oppose the more ranked teams.\n\n\n\nTo India, it could not have been higher. Although it reached two finals (2005 and 2017) and a semifinal in 2022, the women team had not won a world cup. The hosting responsibilities provide an opportunity of golden opportunity to shatter the jinx. \n\n\n\nThe leadership of Harmanpreet Kaur, consistency of Smriti Mandhana and the emergence of youngsters such as Richa Ghosh and Shafali Verma bring a sense of hope to a side which needs glory. India has greatly ambitioned with the help of the home fans to secure a semifinal place at least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrize Money and Growing Investment\n\n\n\nWhile ICC has not formally announced the prize purse, it is expected to mirror or exceed the 2022 edition, where the total pool stood at $3.5 million, with winners receiving $1.32 million. Given the momentum behind women\u2019s cricket, experts anticipate a further bump, signaling the ICC\u2019s commitment to narrowing the financial gap with the men\u2019s game. \n\n\n\nThe Women\u2019s Premier League (WPL) in India has already demonstrated the commercial viability of women\u2019s cricket, and a successful World Cup could accelerate that growth exponentially.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadcasting Channels and OTT Platforms in India\n\n\n\nThe ICC Women World Cup 2025 will not only be a historic event in the field, but also one that has a lot to do with its broadcast coverage. As women cricket is currently growing very popular in India in the last ten years, the news outlets are ready to provide women with comprehensive support through television and web-based channels to engage as many people as possible. \n\n\n\nICC provides some official media rights agreements, which mean that Star Sports Network is entitled to the broadcasting of the tournament in India through the television. The coverage will be inclusive and regionally varied in that the viewers can watch all matches in various languages such as English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada. The sports channels of Star will be likely to include expert panels, pre-match analysis, mid-innings shows and post-match analysis, so that the viewers can get wholesome viewing experience.\n\n\n\nDisney+ Hotstar will be the main OTT streaming platform on the digital front in India, where it will be available with a free and paid subscription (based on plan). As mobile-first consumption is on the increase, Hotstar will enable cricket fans to stream the matches effectively using smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs, and shift the World Cup nearer to the millions of younger consumers who enjoy digital access. It is also anticipated that the platform would be interactive, including live statistics, polls, and fan responses to increase user engagement.\n\n\n\nThe collaboration between the traditional broadcast and OTT will mean that the Women world cup 2025 will be available in households in metros, small towns and rural areas. To the Indian Women\u2019s Cricket Team, this kind of exposure is crucial, as it will make their story known to millions of fans and serve as inspiration to the new generation of cricketers. The 2025 edition can become the most-watched Women\u2019s World Cup in history, and this is possible through its unprecedented coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Future of Indian Women\u2019s Cricket\n\n\n\nBeyond the tournament, the trajectory of Indian women\u2019s cricket is on an upward curve. The establishment of the WPL has created a talent pipeline, giving young players exposure to high-pressure environments. Grassroots initiatives, better pay structures, and infrastructural improvements are beginning to bear fruit. Yet, challenges remain such as inconsistent performances in global events, mental conditioning, and the need for deeper bench strength.\n\n\n\nThe World Cup provides the perfect platform to address these gaps. A strong showing on home soil could galvanize further investment and public interest, positioning India as not just a participant but a global powerhouse in women\u2019s cricket. For millions of young girls watching, seeing Mandhana loft boundaries or Renuka Singh uproot stumps could serve as inspiration to take up the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICC Women\u2019s World Cup 2025 prepares for Historic Kick-Off amid Chinnaswamy Stadium ban\n\n\n\nThe tragic events of June 4 in Bengaluru cast a long shadow on Indian cricket, reminding everyone that safety and planning must always come before spectacle. The ban on M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is both a painful blow and a necessary corrective step. Yet from that loss emerges an opportunity: Navi Mumbai\u2019s DY Patil Stadium now stands poised to script history, hosting crucial clashes of the ICC Women\u2019s World Cup 2025.\n\n\n\nFor India\u2019s women, the road ahead is clear but challenging. They must adapt to new conditions, shoulder the hopes of a nation, and strive to turn years of promise into silverware. As the tournament kicks off, fans will hope the team transforms the sorrow of Bengaluru into the joy of global triumph.\n\n\n\nIn the end, the ICC Women\u2019s World Cup 2025 is not just about cricket. It is about resilience, accountability, and the unyielding spirit of a game that continues to grow, inspire, and unite millions around the world.\n",

      "content_full": "\nIn the dynamic world of T20 strategy, where every ball can change the course of a match, the Indian team is at the forefront of innovating batting tactics. Moving beyond the traditional, rigid batting order, India has adopted a situation-based approach to T20 batting, a philosophy that was on full display in their recent Asia Cup encounter against Oman. \n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t a mere tactical adjustment; it\u2019s a profound shift that positions India as \u2018thought leaders\u2019 in T20 cricket.\n\n\n\nFor decades, the batting lineup was held as a sacred cricketing tradition that dared not be defied. The openers would take on the new ball, the number three would anchor the innings, and the middle order and finishers would provide death overs power-hitting. While this structure offered stability, it also created predictability for the opposition. \n\n\n\nBowlers and captains could meticulously plan their attack, knowing exactly which batter would face them next. India\u2019s current strategy, however, dismantles this orthodoxy, embracing a \u201cfloaters\u201d system where a batter\u2019s position is a tool to be used, not a fixed assignment.\n\n\n\nHow India used their match against Oman as an Experimental showcase\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s match against Oman was the perfect opportunity for India to try out a more fluid batting order. With their Super 4 spot already secured, the team was free to experiment, and they seized the opportunity with both hands.\n\n\n\nInstead of sending in their best batter, Suryakumar Yadav, at his usual number three, the team held him back. This was a deliberate choice to provide opportunities for others who had not had a chance to bat in previous games and to disrupt Oman\u2019s bowling plans. The team\u2019s batting order was made fluid, made to suit strategic decisions dependent on the state of the game.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOne of the most prominent traits from Gautum Gambhir\u2019s tenure as India\u2019s coach is the left-right combination. This is a strategy to put constant pressure on the bowler\u2019s line and length, their run-up, and even their grip, which are all fine-tuned to a specific handedness. \n\n\n\nBy constantly switching the angle and side of the pitch they have to bowl to, a left-right combination prevents them from settling into a rhythm. This is done to bring forth more loose balls and not letting the opposition bowlers settle.\n\n\n\nThe only constants of the Indian batting order are the openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill. Shubman Gill\u2019s dismissal was followed by the right-handed Sanju Samson. Later, the team brought in left-handed all-rounder Axar Patel and the aggressive left-handed batsman Tilak Varma. \n\n\n\nThis created a constant state of flux for the Omani bowlers and fielders, forcing them to make difficult choices with every single run. A field set for a right-hander would have gaps for a left-hander, and vice versa. India\u2019s batters exploited these gaps, converting singles into twos and keeping the scoreboard ticking.\n\n\n\nThe Future of T20 batting\n\n\n\nCan Sanju Samson settle into his new responsiblities in India\u2019s batting order\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s approach is a clear evolution from traditional T20 batting. While many teams still rely on anchor batters in T20 cricket, India is building a team revolving around playing strategic matchups, role players, and maintaining a left-hand right-hand combination at the crease. \n\n\n\nThis philosophy is reminiscent of England\u2019s T20 World Cup winning campaign, where they used a similar \u201cfloaters\u201d system to dismantle bowling attacks with ease.\n\n\n\nThe move to a fluid batting order is a direct response to the demands of modern T20 cricket. With scores of 200+ becoming the norm in Franchise Leagues around the world, a fixed, predictable batting lineup is a liability. \n\n\n\nBy investing in multi-dimensional players who can not only bat but also provide a left-hand-right-hand combination, India is building a deeper, more flexible, and ultimately more dangerous batting lineup.\n\n\n\nThe match against Oman showed that India is not afraid to break from convention and that their batting philosophy is built on innovation and adaptability. \n\n\n\nBy moving beyond the notion of fixed positions, India is unlocking the full potential of its explosive batting lineup and cementing its position as a true pioneer in modern T20 cricket. As the T20 format continues to evolve, this fluid approach may well become the blueprint for future success.\n",

Held in Rajgir, Bihar from August 29 to September 7, the competition carried extra weight because it doubled as the Asian qualifier for the 2026 FIH Men\u2019s Hockey World Cup in Belgium and the Netherlands. \n\n\n\nIndia was one of the pre-tournament favourites, not only due to their position and strength, but due to the increasing momentum in Asian hockey, with such countries as Malaysia, Japan and South Korea continually taking India to greater heights.\n\n\n\nThe group phase revealed the offensive capabilities of India. The men in blue opened against Kazakhstan and were merciless as they registered a 15-0 win that showed how much of a gap there is between the established and the developing nations in the field of hockey.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a statistic, but the margin of victory also increased the goal difference of India, and this would be crucial in the Super 4s stage. India went against China again and won 6-0 through smooth passing and finishing. \n\n\n\nThe factual test was however faced with Japan. During a tense match, Japan was able to draw India 2-2 showing some small weaknesses in defense but also highlighting the fact India could stand their nerves despite being under pressure.\n\n\n\nIndia topped Pool A, and it entered the Super 4s with confidence. Here, consistency was key. The format also meant that any lost point had a possibility of influencing the end-result and India had to shoulder the burden well. Those victories demonstrate a defensive and offensive balance, with a 7-0 demolition of China and a 4-1 one against Malaysia. \n\n\n\nIndia, against defending champions South Korea, went with another 2-2 draw, and though fans were slightly tense, the fact that they had a better goal difference (+10) saw them finish on top of the table. This outcome created an appetizing final match against South Korea who were their long time Asian competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal: India Dethrone South Korea with Clinical 4-1 Win\n\n\n\nThe Rajgir Hockey Stadium was a cauldron of noise on September 7, 2025, as India and South Korea clashed in the Asia Cup final. The atmosphere was electric, with thousands of fans waving the tricolor and chanting \u201cBharat Mata Ki Jai.\u201d For India, this was more than a title match, it was a chance to reclaim continental supremacy after years of fluctuating fortunes in Asia.\n\n\n\nIndia had started off with a dream. Sukhjeet Singh, within the first minute tied a through ball and scored a field goal, and the people were in frenzy. The jump-start strike shook South Korea, who are reputed to be a disciplined defensive formation. Feeling exposed, India stressed high and made forced errors. They got what they deserved when Dilpreet Singh scored in the 28th minute with a perfect finish following a fast-moving pass.\n\n\n\nThe third quarter was the statement of intent for India. As Korea pursued the game, India took advantage of the penalty corners. In the 50th minute, long-serving defender Amit Rohidas pulled off a thunderbolt drag flick that practically ended the match 4-0. The result was not in question and South Korea made one back in the 51st minute through Son Dain.\n\n\n\nThe characteristic of this final was the Indian strategic performance. The focus of coach Craig Fulton on quick, swift transitioning and harsh penalty corner conversions was ideal. They were under pressure, but the defense led by Harmanpreet Singh and Rohidas managed the situation very well, with the goalkeeper saving the day with timely saves at the right time.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the game, the score was in favour of India with 4 goals to 1 goal for South Korea, which not only gave India the title of the Asia Cup but also a direct ticket to the 2026 FIH World Cup. It was a reward to the players and vindication of the hockey revival in India to the fans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMen\u2019s Asia Cup: Final Standings and Awards\n\n\n\nThe Asia Cup 2025 concluded with India at the pinnacle, but the tournament was rich with storylines from other teams as well. South Korea, though beaten in the final, reaffirmed their position as a resilient force in Asian hockey. Malaysia impressed with attacking flair, while China showed glimpses of progress but lacked consistency.\n\n\n\nFinal Standings:\n\n\n\n\nIndia \u2013 Champions\n\n\n\nSouth Korea \u2013 Runners-up\n\n\n\nMalaysia \u2013 Third Place\n\n\n\nChina \u2013 Fourth Place\n\n\n\n\nThe awards reflected individual brilliance:\n\n\n\n\nBest Player: Abhishek Nain (India) \u2013 His dynamic playmaking and versatility in midfield made him indispensable.\n\n\n\nBest Goalkeeper: Kim Jae-hyeon (South Korea) \u2013 Despite conceding in the final, his reflexes and shot-stopping throughout the tournament were outstanding.\n\n\n\nBest Young Player: Andy Jefferyan (Malaysia) \u2013 A revelation in attack, he terrorized defenses with pace and creativity.\n\n\n\nTop Scorer: Akhimullah Anuar (Malaysia) \u2013 His tally of 12 goals highlighted Malaysia\u2019s attacking intent.\n\n\n\n\nThe men\u2019s tournament saw a total of 164 goals, averaging 6.83 per game. This high scoring rate was evidence of Asia\u2019s attacking hockey tradition, though it also revealed defensive lapses that teams like India will need to tighten when facing European or Australian opposition.\n\n\n\nFor India, lifting the trophy on home soil was symbolic. It reflected not just a sporting triumph but also the successful organization of a marquee event in Rajgir, a city not traditionally associated with global hockey. The success may well encourage Hockey India to continue spreading the sport beyond its established hubs.\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Asia Cup Drama in Hangzhou\n\n\n\nAs the men\u2019s team celebrated in Rajgir, attention was turned to Hangzhou, China where the 2025 Women Asia Cup was fought within the period of September 5 to 14. The tournament had two targets for the Indian women; to not only win the continental championship but also to be assured of direct entry into the 2026 Women\u2019s Hockey World Cup.\n\n\n\nIndia got off their campaign on a grand note. This time they defeated Thailand 11-0 with forwards such as Mumtaz Khan and Navneet Kaur running riot. This continued through the momentum against Singapore where they scored 12-0 displaying attacking depth and fitness. These performances highlighted the superiority of India over weaker teams as well as increased expectations before tougher tasks.\n\n\n\nThe experience with Japan was much more difficult. In a tactical battle, India and Japan made a draw, 2-2 which also indicated the technical discipline of both sides. India had an opportunity to score goals, but the lack of defense gave Japan a chance to remain in the game.\n\n\n\nEntering the Super 4s, India had their most difficult matches. It was followed by a demoralizing 1-4 defeat to hosts China after drawing with Japan 1-1. The loss revealed weaknesses in Indian defense especially when it came to dealing with the Chinese drag flick masters as well as with overlapping runs. \n\n\n\nHowever, India ended up on the second in the group and thus made it to the final with China and the two Asian powerhouses in women team competitions clashed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal: China Break Indian Hearts by 4-1\n\n\n\nThe final of the September 14 in the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center started as a dream for India. Within the first minute, the Indian team earned a brilliant penalty corner conversion, which was scored by Navneet Kaur, and India took the lead of 1-0, which caught even the partisan Chinese crowd off its guard. \n\n\n\nThe aim gave the Indian camp a feeling of belief and at this time it seemed that history was being made.\n\n\n\nHowever, China was not going to be shaken. Their equalizer was achieved in the second quarter with the help of Ou Zixia whose finish of a short distance revealed defensive gaps. Later in the game, China became complacent. Li Hong scored in the third quarter which made the hosts lead 2-1. The Indian midfield was failing to keep up with the Chinese formation.\n\n\n\nChina struck the deadly blows in the fourth quarter. Meirong Zou hit in the 53rd minute and it was her 11th goal of the tournament, and a goal by Zhong Jiaqi in the 58th minute finished the match. The final whistle confirmed China\u2019s 4-1 triumph, leaving India with silver medals.\n\n\n\nIt was a painful defeat and shed light on the areas where improvement was necessary. As the forwards of India provided opportunities, the lapses of the defense and failure to endure the constant pressure cost the team a lot. Coach Janneke Schopman admitted that there is some difference, and more mental toughness is required during crunch time.\n\n\n\nTo China, the triumph was a historic one. With the extensive support of the passionate supporters at home, they not only won the Asia Cup but also secured their spot in the 2026 world cup. They based their success on the tactical discipline, the clinical finishing and brilliance of Zou Meirong who became the best goal scorer in the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Asia Cup: Final Standings and Awards\n\n\n\nThe 2025 Women\u2019s Asia Cup was a showcase of the continent\u2019s growing competitiveness in hockey. While India emerged as runners-up, the tournament reflected the steady rise of Asian women\u2019s hockey, with China reclaiming dominance and Japan continuing to demonstrate consistency.\n\n\n\nFinal Standings:\n\n\n\n\nChina \u2013 Champions\n\n\n\nIndia \u2013 Runners-up\n\n\n\nJapan \u2013 Third Place\n\n\n\nSouth Korea \u2013 Fourth Place\n\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s victory on home soil was no accident. Their system of structured hockey academies and domestic league support produced players with strong tactical awareness. They went unbeaten throughout the tournament and capped it off with a commanding final performance.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s silver medal finish was bittersweet. The campaign showcased their ability to dominate lesser-ranked opponents but also exposed gaps in closing out big games. Still, finishing in the top two secured them a coveted direct entry to the 2026 FIH Women\u2019s World Cup in Belgium and the Netherlands, ensuring their focus can shift entirely to preparation instead of qualification hurdles.\n\n\n\nKey Awards:\n\n\n\n\nBest Player: Zou Meirong (China) \u2013 With 11 goals, including a crucial strike in the final, Zou was the heartbeat of China\u2019s attack. Her ability to exploit space and convert penalty corners made her unplayable at times.\n\n\n\nBest Goalkeeper: Savita Punia (India) \u2013 Despite India\u2019s defeat in the final, Savita was outstanding throughout the tournament. Her reflex saves, particularly in the Super 4s, kept India in contention.\n\n\n\nBest Young Player: Akane Shibata (Japan) \u2013 The young forward showed composure beyond her years, adding flair to Japan\u2019s disciplined style of play.\n\n\n\nTop Scorer: Zou Meirong (China, 11 goals).\n\n\n\n\nThe women\u2019s competition saw a total of 173 goals, averaging 6.18 goals per game. This balance between attack and defense reflected the increasing tactical sophistication of Asian women\u2019s hockey.\n\n\n\nFrom India\u2019s perspective, there were positives: Navneet Kaur\u2019s leadership in attack, Lalremsiami\u2019s versatility, and the reliability of midfielder Neha Goyal. Yet, defensive organization under pressure and maintaining intensity in the final quarters remain pressing issues. The silver medal, while not the ultimate prize, reaffirmed India\u2019s place among Asia\u2019s elite and highlighted their potential on the global stage.\n\n\n\nComparing the Two Campaigns of Asia Cup 2025\n\n\n\nWhen evaluating India\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s campaigns side by side, the contrast is striking. The men\u2019s team entered as favorites and delivered, showcasing consistency, firepower, and tactical maturity. The women\u2019s team, meanwhile, displayed moments of brilliance but faltered at the decisive hurdle against a disciplined Chinese outfit.\n\n\n\nStrengths of the Men\u2019s Team:\n\n\n\n\nDepth in attacking options, with players like Sukhjeet Singh, Dilpreet Singh, and Abhishek Nain stepping up at crucial moments.\n\n\n\nA rock-solid defensive structure led by Harmanpreet Singh and Amit Rohidas.\n\n\n\nThe experience of the keeper in goal, providing stability.\n\n\n\nEfficient penalty corner conversion, which has long been India\u2019s strength.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges for the Men:\n\n\n\n\nOccasional lapses in concentration, as seen in draws against Japan and South Korea.\n\n\n\nOver-reliance on a few star players in crunch moments.\n\n\n\n\nStrengths of the Women\u2019s Team:\n\n\n\n\nExplosive forward line, led by Navneet Kaur and Mumtaz Khan.\n\n\n\nSavita Punia\u2019s brilliance in goal, often bailing the team out of tough situations.\n\n\n\nMidfield creativity through Vandana Katariya and Neha Goyal.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges for the Women:\n\n\n\n\nInconsistency against top-tier Asian opponents like China.\n\n\n\nDefensive vulnerability in penalty corner situations.\n\n\n\nMental resilience in high-pressure matches.\n\n\n\n\nTogether, the two campaigns underline a broader truth: Indian hockey is in transition but on the rise. The men\u2019s team, buoyed by their Olympic medal in 2021 and solid showings in global competitions, look poised to challenge the best at the World Cup. The women, despite setbacks, continue to punch above their historical weight and are on the cusp of breaking into the world\u2019s top four consistently.\n\n\n\nThe Asia Cups of 2025 serve as a reminder that while titles are sweet, they are steppingstones toward the bigger stage of the World Cup. Both squads have reason to celebrate, reflect, and prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoad to the 2026 FIH World Cups\n\n\n\nThe next major milestone for both teams is the 2026 FIH Hockey World Cup, to be co-hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands. Scheduled for July 2026, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments promise to be historic, not only for the host nations, both hockey powerhouses, but also for India, whose teams will arrive with heightened expectations.\n\n\n\nFor the Men\u2019s Team\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s qualification through Asia Cup triumph ensures they will avoid the stress of playoffs and can focus on long-term preparation. The key areas of attention will include:\n\n\n\n\nFitness and Conditioning: Competing against European teams like Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany requires peak fitness to match their relentless pace.\n\n\n\nPenalty Corner Innovation: While India\u2019s drag flickers remain potent, introducing variations can keep opponents guessing.\n\n\n\nYouth Integration: Rising stars from junior ranks must be blended with experienced players to ensure squad depth.\n\n\n\n\nThe men\u2019s World Cup will see India face stiff competition, especially from Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia. Yet, their Asia Cup triumph provides the psychological edge of being champions from one of the toughest continental tournaments.\n\n\n\nFor the Women\u2019s Team\n\n\n\nThe silver medal at Hangzhou secured direct entry, a relief for a team that has sometimes struggled in qualification rounds. Preparation priorities include:\n\n\n\n\nDefensive Organization: Tightening marking and improving penalty corner defense.\n\n\n\nPsychological Conditioning: Building resilience to handle pressure in crunch games.\n\n\n\nExposure Tours: Playing regularly against European teams to acclimatize to their high-intensity hockey.\n\n\n\n\nThe women\u2019s World Cup will be fiercely competitive, with the likes of the Netherlands, Argentina, and Germany setting the gold standard. India\u2019s aim will be to break into the semifinals, a realistic but challenging target.\n\n\n\nBroader Vision: Hockey India\u2019s Roadmap\n\n\n\nHockey India has already launched programs aimed at 2026 and beyond. Investments in grassroots academies, sports science, and analytics are beginning to bear fruit. The success of both Asia Cups is proof that India is no longer an inconsistent force but a team with sustained potential.\n\n\n\nThe Vision 2026 Plan emphasizes building depth across both genders, improving infrastructure, and making hockey accessible beyond traditional strongholds like Punjab, Odisha, and Haryana. Hosting international tournaments in new centers like Rajgir further boosts the sport\u2019s footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Tale of Two Journeys\n\n\n\nThe 2025 Asia Cups were historic for Indian hockey. For the men, it was a story of dominance, resilience, and eventual glory. For the women, it was a tale of near triumph and valuable lessons. Together, these journeys underline the rise of Indian hockey as a force not just in Asia but also on the world stage.\n\n\n\nThe victory of the men over South Korea in Rajgir was symbolic, which says that the golden days of Indian hockey could be echoed in the modern days. The second-place performance of the women, which was heartbreaking in the final, served to demonstrate the fact that they were able to match the best of Asia, and that they would have a strong World Cup performance.\n\n\n\nBy 2026, the focus will be on Belgium and the Netherlands, but the tricolor will be flying high since both Indian teams will go there with ambition and hunger. The men will seek to transform continental superiority into international triumph, and the females will hope to get past the semifinal barrier that has always baffled them.\n\n\n\nThe dual momentum is what is peculiar to this moment. It is unusual in the history of Indian hockey that the men and women teams have been so competitive simultaneously. This is the result of the systemic evolutions, improved training facilities, introduction to international hockey and the new emphasis upon fitness and sports science.\n\n\n\nFinally, the Asia Cups 2025 were not only tournaments but steppingstones. They demonstrated what can be done to Indian hockey when it is prepared with a passion. With the count to the world cup starting, it is now evident that India is geared up to write new history of hockey around the globe.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe Afghanistan Bangladesh contest was critical for both sides in this Asia Cup with a chance of cementing a place in the Super Four up for grabs. It was a contest between an Afghanistan that is looking for its batting legs and a young Bangladesh team who are finally playing like a modern T20 side.\n\n\n\nBangladesh pulled through by a narrow margin of 8 runs, defending a middling total of 154 in the second innings. The win was courtesy of their spin duo of Rishad Hossain and Nasum Ahmed, and their death overs veteran Mustafizur Rahman, who contributed with 3 important lower-order wickets.\n\n\n\nBatting woes for Bangladesh on a gripping Dubai Pitch\n\n\n\nBoth teams had their fair share of woes on a pitch that initially looked batting friendly when Bangladesh took a flying start to the game. Tanzid Hasan with his half century was the only Bangladeshi top or middle order batter who took an aggressive approach towards Afghan bowlers. The rest of the Bangladeshi lineup looked clueless while the Afghan spinners choked out their runs.\n\n\n\nBangladesh scored 59 runs in the first 6 overs and got off to a flying start in the powerplay but only managed to score another 95 runs for the loss of 5 wickets in the rest of the innings. The middle overs was dominated by the Afghan spinner duo of Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed who delivered with efficient spells of 2-26 and 2-23 respectively.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOther than Tanzid in the powerplay and Nurul Hasan at the death, the Bangladeshi batters seemed to be all too comfortable to go back to anchoring the innings. This strategy only slowed them down and led them to losing more wickets to the Afghani spinners in the middle overs. Bangladesh put up a middling score of 154 runs on the board that they\u2019d need to bowl quite well to defend in the second innings.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfghanistan bled some runs on the field due to some shoddy fielding on their part. While they did hold on to their catches, their fielding led to them conceding some runs on the field. Runs that would have been handy considering that they only lost the match by 8 runs. Afghanistan need to work on their powerplay bowling and their fielding if they want to tighten the chokehold that their spinners lay out for them.\n\n\n\nBangladeshi spinners run through Afghan top order\n\n\n\nRishad Hossain bowled a very important spell of 2-18.\n\n\n\nThe very first ball of the second innings got Sediqallah Atal trapped plum in front of the stumps by Nasum Shah. This set the precedent for the rest of the innings as the Afghan top order lapsed to the finger spin of Nasum Shah who always kept the stumps in play and the wrist spin of Rishad Hossain.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMuch like the Bangladeshis, the Afghan batters tried to go back to anchoring the innings and tried to go for singles and twos rather than boundaries. This only increased the pressure as Afghanistan got to 27/2 after the powerplay. As pressure grew, Bangladesh seem to tighten their web of spin around the Afghan batters who could not hold their own against the pressure and were not able to score runs at a secure rate.\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s instinct to anchor the innings took over, and their batters did not try to go for boundaries. Losing further wickets only slowed them down, so that after the spinners were done with their overs, Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed finished the job, taking the remaining wickets in the latter half of the innings.\n\n\n\nAmong the batters, only Azmatullah Omarzai and Rashid Khan tried to hit out at the death, but by that time, they had lost too many wickets to the Bangladeshi bowlers. Bangladesh tried to bowl part-timers like Shamim Hossain and Saif Hassan because the pitch was providing assistance to spinners, but Omarzai targeted them for boundaries.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLow-scoring batting plagued both teams, as they were bailed out by their bowling attacks. Afghanistan and Bangladesh both seemed to go back to their anchoring batting tactics in their batting innings when they faced pressure. Both bowling units shined, and Bangladesh were triumphant mainly due to their powerplay hitting and taking wickets early in the second innings.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo advance further in the tournament need to look into their batting and trying to make it more aggressive if they want to compete against top sides such as India. Afghanistan need to win their game against Srilanka to qualify for the Super Fours which is a tough contest waiting for them.\n",

      "content_full": "\nIndian athletics has been waiting a long time for a sprint story worth telling. That story finally arrived this year, and it has a clear headline: Animesh Kujur is the fastest man in India.\n\n\n\nIt happened on a summer evening in Vari, Greece. July 5, 2025. The Dromia International Sprint & Relays Meet isn\u2019t usually a stage where Indians make global noise, but Kujur did. He ran the 100m in 10.18 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen-point-one-eight. The number matters. Because until then, no Indian had dipped under 10.20 seconds. Gurindervir Singh\u2019s old mark of 10.20 was gone, and India suddenly had a sprinter timed inside that bracket. \n\n\n\nSource: Times of India\n\n\n\nIt may not sound like much of a margin 0.02s but in the world of sprinting it is massive. A lean at the tape, a stronger start, the slightest difference in stride turnover, that\u2019s all it takes. And for India, it meant history.\n\n\n\nThe story didn\u2019t begin in Greece though. Earlier, in April 2025, the Federation Cup in Bhubaneswar saw Kujur clock 20.40 seconds in the 200m. That timing erased Amlan Borgohain\u2019s 20.52s record and, for a while, made Kujur the fastest man in Asia over 200m. The numbers showed up in official season lists an Indian name at the top, rare enough to make people double-check.\n\n\n\nSource: Outlook\n\n\n\nThen came South Korea, the Asian Athletics Championships in Gumi. Kujur not only held his nerve in a continental final, he went quicker: 20.32 seconds. That run fetched him the bronze medal and a fresh Indian national record. The difference between him and the gold medalist was hardly a stride. India had a sprinter on the podium in Asia, something that doesn\u2019t happen often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelay teams often don\u2019t get the same attention, but this year they mattered too. With Gurindervir, Manikanta, and Borgohain alongside him, Kujur helped India\u2019s 4x100m team run 38.69 seconds yet another national record. It showed India isn\u2019t just producing one-off performances, but piecing together squads that can compete at Asian level.\n\n\n\nBut the biggest headline came away from Asia. Kujur qualified for the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, the first Indian male sprinter to ever do so. That\u2019s not a small footnote; it\u2019s a marker of progress.\n\n\n\nSource: Outlook, NDTV, Times of India\n\n\n\n\nINDIA'S FASTEST MEN ANIMESH IS HERE \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\u26a1 pic.twitter.com/9itj3Y6n9n\u2014 The Khel India (@TheKhelIndia) September 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\nAt the Championships, he ran the 200m heats. His time: 20.77 seconds. On paper, that left him ninth in his heat, 42nd overall out of 52 athletes. Not enough for the semifinals. But think of what it meant an Indian sprinter on the same track as finalists from the Olympics and Diamond League. Just reaching that stage was breaking new ground \n\n\n\nSource: Khel Now\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s stack his year:\n\n\n\n\n100m \u2013 10.18s in Greece, new national record.\n\n\n\n200m \u2013 20.32s in Gumi, another record + Asian bronze.\n\n\n\nRelay 4x100m \u2013 38.69s, national record.\n\n\n\nWorld Championships \u2013 first Indian male sprinter to qualify, 200m debut at Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Animesh\u2019s Rise Means for Indian Athletics\n\n\n\nThree records, a medal, and a World Championships appearance all in one season. That\u2019s not normal in Indian athletics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal comparisons are tricky. Usain Bolt\u2019s 9.58 (100m) and 19.19 (200m) are still galaxies away. Even in Asia, Japan and China regularly push sub-10 and sub-20. But the context is important. India has never consistently produced sub-10.20 sprinters, let alone World Championships qualifiers. Animesh has changed that conversation.\n\n\n\nAnother point that sets him apart: he\u2019s done it across venues. Some Indian sprinters have run quick times domestically and then struggled abroad. Kujur\u2019s records came in Bhubaneswar, in South Korea, in Greece. He has carried form across different tracks, conditions, and levels of competition. That\u2019s the mark of someone reliable, not a one-day wonder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what next? The dream target is obvious break the 10-second barrier in the 100m and the 20-second wall in the 200m. Nobody from India has done either. Is it possible? Hard to say. The margins at that level are cruel. But what seemed unthinkable five years ago doesn\u2019t look impossible today.\n\n\n\nEven without those global numbers, the cultural impact is clear. For the first time in memory, kids at Indian tracks have a sprinter to name, someone whose timing stands up internationally. Not just another long-distance runner or javelin thrower, but a genuine short-distance star.\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nBCCI\u2019s Big Move: Apollo Tyres Wins Team India Jersey Rights in \u20b9579 Crore Deal\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates, and\u00a0stay tuned!\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has announced Apollo Tyres as the new lead sponsor of the Indian cricket team\u2019s jersey in a record-breaking agreement worth \u20b9579 crore. The deal will run until March 2028 and covers both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams across formats. With this, Apollo Tyres takes one of the most visible sponsorship slots in world cricket, placing its brand on the jersey that symbolizes national pride for millions of Indian fans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis announcement comes in the wake of Dream11 stepping away from the role due to regulatory restrictions that now prevent gaming companies from sponsoring the national cricket jersey. The vacuum created an opportunity for traditional consumer brands to step forward, and Apollo seized it with an aggressive bid. Reports suggest that the company\u2019s winning figure was about 28 percent higher than the BCCI\u2019s reserve price, reflecting the extraordinary value associated with Team India\u2019s global reach.\n\n\n\nSource: Indian Express\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers behind the contract underline its significance. Media reports indicate that the agreement will cover around 142 matches during its tenure, including 121 bilateral fixtures and 21 ICC events. This brings the per-match valuation to roughly \u20b94.5 crore, a figure that highlights the unmatched commercial strength of Indian cricket. \n\n\n\nFew sporting properties worldwide command this level of sponsorship, and for Apollo Tyres it represents an opportunity to gain billions of impressions through broadcast, digital platforms, and on-ground exposure.\n\n\n\n\nApollo Tyres Clinches India\u2019s Jersey Sponsorship, Outbidding Canva and JK Cement with a \u20b9579 Crore Deal! pic.twitter.com/Ao32uStRI0\u2014 CRICKETNMORE (@cricketnmore) September 16, 2025\n\n\n\n\nThe bidding process itself was competitive, attracting interest from several major companies. Canva, JK Cements and its associate JK Tyre, along with Birla Optus Paints, were among the names linked with the race for the jersey rights. Ultimately, Apollo\u2019s bid outpaced the others, securing the contract and positioning the company at the center of Indian cricket\u2019s commercial landscape.\n\n\n\nSource: Economic Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the BCCI, the deal provides much-needed stability in its sponsorship portfolio. The revenue generated is not simply about branding; it directly supports the operations of Indian cricket at multiple levels. Money from such partnerships is often invested in infrastructure, player welfare, domestic tournaments, and the expansion of women\u2019s cricket. \n\n\n\nAt a time when categories like gaming, betting, and crypto are barred, the ability to attract a \u20b9579 crore commitment from a traditional consumer brand demonstrates the board\u2019s ongoing dominance in the sponsorship market.\n\n\n\nCompared with the previous deal held by Dream11, Apollo\u2019s agreement is a step up both in value and scope. Dream11\u2019s sponsorship had been pegged at a lower figure, and there were concerns that restrictions on gaming companies would dampen interest in future contracts. \n\n\n\nInstead, Apollo\u2019s record bid has reaffirmed the BCCI\u2019s power to command top-dollar sponsorships, proving once again that the Indian team\u2019s jersey is not just a piece of sporting attire but a global marketing platform.\n\n\n\nSource: Hindustan Times\n\n\n\n\nBCCI announces Apollo Tyres as the new lead Sponsor of Team India. pic.twitter.com/jRNawRdn5K\u2014 ANI (@ANI) September 16, 2025\n\n\n\n\nFor Apollo Tyres, the benefits are enormous. Beyond the exposure on live broadcasts and highlight reels, the company gains an emotional association with the Indian cricket team. \n\n\n\nEvery time players walk out wearing the jersey, the brand shares space with the pride and passion of more than a billion fans. This emotional connection, combined with international visibility, gives Apollo a platform to reinforce its global ambitions and strengthen its recall in both domestic and overseas markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward, the Apollo deal could set the tone for future sponsorships. With gaming brands sidelined, companies from consumer goods, automotive, industrial, and even technology sectors are likely to view cricket sponsorship as an even more attractive investment. \n\n\n\nThe Apollo agreement shows that despite restrictions, the commercial value of Indian cricket is only rising. For fans, the change will be visible when Team India takes the field in their new jerseys. For the BCCI, it marks another leap in its already impressive financial ecosystem. And for Apollo, it is a statement of intent, blending business strategy with national pride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, this is more than a commercial contract. It is a reminder that Indian cricket continues to be the single most powerful sporting property in the country and one of the most valuable in the world. Apollo Tyres\u2019 \u20b9579 crore sponsorship proves that even in a shifting regulatory environment, the game\u2019s reach and influence remain unmatched, ensuring that the Indian jersey remains one of the most coveted spaces in global sport.\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nMondo Duplantis Defies Gravity Again \u2013 14th Pole Vault World Record!\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates, and\u00a0stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n",

Despite strong contributions from key batters , India fell just short . \n\n\n\nPratika Rawal scored 64, Smriti Mandhana made 58 , and Harleen Deol contributed 54 runs , while the opening wicket partnership of 114 runs set a promising platform . However the middle and lower order could not maintain momentum , and the Women in Blue were left 20 -30 runs short with the bat as admitted by captain Harmanpreet Kaur .\n\n\n\nThe second ODI presents an opportunity for India to regroup rectify mistakes and display resilience . Top batters like Smriti Mandhana , Jemimah Rodrigues , and young Pratika Rawal will need to play decisive innings , while the bowlers will have the challenge of containing Australia\u2019s experienced lineup. \n\n\n\nIndia must balance aggression with consistency , build partnerships , and finish their innings strongly to put pressure on the defending champions .\n\n\n\nSquads and Key Players to Watch \n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s squad is a blend of experience and youth , with Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues providing stability at the top, Pratika Rawal adding firepower and wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh ready to make crucial contributions behind the stumps . \n\n\n\nAll rounders Deepti Sharma and Renuka Singh Thakur , along with pace and spin options led by Arundhati Reddy , Shree Charani , and Radha Yadav , will play a pivotal role in restricting Australia\u2019s batters.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s team boasts stars like Alyssa Healy , Ellyse Peery , Beth Mooney , Ashleigh Gardner and Tahila McGrath , making them a formidable opponent in every department . Their ability to chase challenging totals consistently makes them a tough challenge and India will need to maintain focus throughout the match to avoid a repeat of the first ODI outcome.\n\n\n\nExpectations from the Second ODI\n\n\n\nThe 2nd ODI will test India\u2019s resilience and composure under pressure against one of the strongest sides in women\u2019s cricket . Fans can expect a thrilling contest with intense batting disciplined bowling , and critical fielding moments. \n\n\n\nThis match gives India a chance to level the series , regain confidence and set up an exciting finale for three match series . Every run, wicket and partnership will be crucial, and the Women in Blue must perform at their best to challenge the world champions and keep the series alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe enthusiasm of women in Indian cricket continues to rise with the fourth season of the Women\u2019s Premier League, also known as the WPL, approaching. The WPL 2026, which is scheduled to begin at the start of the first week of January 2026, represents a significant deviation in timing, planning, and organisation. \n\n\n\nThe strategic move taken by the Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) of promoting the competition was done to ensure that WPL gets the required attention as much as it is possible without inconvenience to other events that are essential to the game of cricket.\n\n\n\nWPL 2026: New Season, New Schedule\n\n\n\nThe WPL 2026 will begin between January 6 and January 8, 2026, as compared to its normal date, which is between February and March. This was changed mostly due to the fact that it would avoid conflict with the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup that will be hosted by India and Sri Lanka in February and March 2026. \n\n\n\nBeing as popular as two competitions being organised simultaneously, it is possible that the media coverage and viewership will be lower. The early start date will let the WPL stand alone and guarantee that spectators can enjoy both tournaments without any overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis option also corresponds with the Future Tours Programme (FTP) of women\u2019s cricket, which, like most other international events such as the Women\u2019s Big Bash League and The Hundred of Women, has a set schedule regarding major leagues.\n\n\n\nFormat and Fixtures:\n\n\n\nWPL 2026 will continue to be played in its well-known and popular format of the WPL 2026, in which each team will play the other teams twice before entering into the playoffs. \n\n\n\nThe fourth and third places will have an elimination round, and the two remaining highest-performing teams in the league phase will be used to play the final. Such a format will make sure that the teams are competing stiffly to secure a spot in the playoffs and the event becomes competitive.\n\n\n\nThis competition will last approximately four to five weeks, and the matches will take place in various locations to bring the fans in various locations. BCCI still has not determined the schedule, but it is assumed that it will be conducted in various locations.\n\n\n\nTeams:\n\n\n\nFive franchises will compete for the trophy again:\n\n\n\n\nThe current champions, the Mumbai Indians, are known to be very savvy in their acquisitions and a strong core.\n\n\n\nDelhi Capitals are eager to come with both fresh and seasoned players.\n\n\n\nThe Gujarat Giants is one of the teams that have proven to have the potential to perform and excellent performances.\n\n\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) is an established fan-favourite team and is loaded with star power and style.\n\n\n\nUP Warriorz is a competitive team hoping to establish itself in the upcoming campaign. Additionally, Abhishek Nayar joined as head coach of UP Warriorz ahead of WPL 2026. \n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea8 JUST IN: Abhishek Nayar has been named the new head coach of UP Warriorz ahead of #WPL2026 #wpl #abhisheknayar #upwarriorz pic.twitter.com/bWdnWum6Hk\u2014 Cricbuzz (@cricbuzz) July 25, 2025\n\n\n\nIn contrast to past editions, the teams are going to be put together via an auction which is expected to take place in November 2025. This change will also give teams more time to prepare their campaigns adequately and prepare the event. International celebrities and emerging Indian talent will probably be mixed together at the auction, enabling teams to assemble well-rounded teams.\n\n\n\nWPL 2026: Auction and Strategy\n\n\n\nIn order to give teams time to plan before the WPL 2026 begins, the early auction will be essential. According to analysts, teams will concentrate on acquiring players who can perform well under pressure and provide versatility in the bowling and batting departments. There will also be extensive scouting of new players from tournaments, such as the Senior Women\u2019s One Day Trophy and Under-19 competitions and other domestic tournaments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, teams will try to sign players who are available for the duration of the competition and are not committed to overlapping international commitments as the global women\u2019s cricket calendar grows.\n\n\n\nFixtures and Fan Engagement:\n\n\n\nIt has been proposed in sources that cities such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, Lucknow and Vadodara are likely targets in the case of WPL 2026, based on the facilities, coverage of the audience and experience of hosting a similar event; the actual venue of the event is yet to be announced. BCCI is supposed to improve the interaction with the fans through the community events and internet tools and make the matches more accessible through mobile applications and video providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sport\u2019s grassroots reach is also being increased by campaigns that encourage girls to play professional cricket in an attempt to draw in younger fans.\n\n\n\nImpact on Women\u2019s Cricket:\n\n\n\nThe initiative to host the WPL 2026 in January shows greater commitment to the growth of women in the international game of cricket. The competition will draw the top talent and provide Indian players additional competitive opportunities by allowing players a designated window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WPL is a ray of hope for young females who want to play professionally since it provides career pathways in addition to role models. Due to the tournament\u2019s previous success, women\u2019s cricket infrastructure has already seen increases in sponsorship, viewership, and investment.\n\n\n\nThere are more expectations than ever as the WPL 2026 is set to begin. The competition looks to be the ideal fusion of inspiration, entertainment, and skill. Before the Men\u2019s T20 World Cup starts, spectators will be treated to nonstop cricket action, and teams will have plenty of time to prepare thanks to the early January start.\n\n\n\nThe WPL has become more than a competition; it is a movement that symbolises the development of women\u2019s sporting activities in India. It is high time to have another thrilling season, with women\u2019s cricket taking a new turn in order to achieve greater heights, with teams fighting over their tactics and players trying to demonstrate their skills.\n",

The crowd\u2019s roar told the rest of the story. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI just had to trust myself,\u201d \n\n\n\n\nDuplantis said afterwards, almost casual, like he hadn\u2019t just rewritten athletics history.\n\n\n\nA Habit of Records\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t his first dance with history. Back in 2020, when he first cracked Renaud Lavillenie\u2019s record with 6.17m in Poland, he looked like the sport\u2019s future. A week later he jumped 6.18m, proving it wasn\u2019t luck.\n\n\n\n\nMondo Duplantis' \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea Pole Vault World Record timeline is CRAZY!!\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\udd252020 \u2013 6.17m2020 \u2013 6.18m2022 \u2013  6.19m2022 \u2013 6.20m2022 \u2013 6.21m2023 \u2013 6.22m2023 \u2013 6.23m2024 \u2013 6.24m2024 \u2013 6.25m2024 \u2013 6.26m2025 \u2013 6.27m2025 \u2013 6.28m2025 \u2013 6.29m2025 \u2013 6.30m \ud83c\udd95\ufe0f14 World\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pHHwmfHD7I\u2014 Track & Field Gazette (@TrackGazette) September 15, 2025\n\n\n\n\nSince then, the numbers stack up almost absurdly: 6.20m in Belgrade (2022), 6.21m in Eugene the same year, 6.22m in France, 6.23m again in Eugene, 6.24m in Glasgow, 6.25, 6.26, 6.27\u2026 all the way up to 6.29 last month. Each one felt like a ceiling. Each one became a stepping stone.\n\n\n\nNow 6.30m, on a damp track in Tokyo. See full record progression\n\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\n\nThe Competition Wasn\u2019t the Competition\n\n\n\nTo be fair, there were medals being won too. Emmanouil Karalis of Greece cleared 6.00m for silver, Kurtis Marschall took bronze at 5.95m. Strong marks. On most nights they\u2019d be headlines. But against Duplantis? They were background music.\n\n\n\n\nKaralis \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7 vs. Duplantis \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea tops the battles of the night.They\u2019ve both cleared 6 metres on first attempt in the pole vault final here in Tokyo \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5.

The bar could have stayed at 6.10 and nobody would\u2019ve complained. But that\u2019s not how Duplantis operates. He wants to go higher, every time.\n\n\n\nSource: Reuters\n\n\n\nThe Numbers Behind the Madness\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: six metres is supposed to be the holy grail. For most vaulters, it\u2019s one magical clearance in a lifetime. Duplantis has done it over 80 times already. Sergey Bubka, the great pioneer, did it 44 times in his whole career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat stat alone explains why Duplantis is different. He isn\u2019t brushing up against the extraordinary once in a while, he lives there. His \u201cnormal\u201d is everyone else\u2019s dream mark.\n\n\n\nSource: Olympics\n\n\n\nThird Time, Right Time\n\n\n\nIt nearly slipped away. Two ugly misses at 6.30m had people muttering. Maybe tonight wasn\u2019t the night. Maybe the long season had caught up with him. But then he steadied, breathed, and sprinted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPole bent, body lifted, bar rattled. For a moment, time froze. Then the bar held. \u201cThat was close,\u201d he laughed later. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can afford too many more like that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s Duplantis in a nutshell. Perfection built on moments of chaos.\n\n\n\nPole Vault\u2019s Unlikely Superstar\n\n\n\nPole vault used to be niche, tucked away behind the glamour of sprints and distance races. Duplantis has blown it open. Fans now show up just to watch him. TV cameras linger. Every run-up feels like a possible record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has turned the event into something bigger, into must-see sport. The Bolt effect, but with poles and crossbars instead of spikes and straightaways.\n\n\n\nHow High Is High Enough?\n\n\n\nAt 25, Duplantis is still climbing. Athletes in this event often peak late, so who knows where the bar stops \u2013 6.35? 6.40?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe shrugged when asked. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think about limits. I just think about the next jump.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSimple words, but after fourteen world records, they carry weight.\n\n\n\nThe Takeaway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here we are again. Another city, another stunned crowd, another centimetre higher. Fourteen times in five years he\u2019s moved the mark. And if you watched him walk off the Tokyo runway smiling, you had the sense this wasn\u2019t the finish line.\n\n\n\nIt was just another checkpoint.\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nDerby Demolition: Manchester City\u2019s 3-0 Statement On Manchester United\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates, and\u00a0stay tuned!\n",

They pressed high, snapped into tackles, and turned every loose ball into a chance. United? They looked nervous from the off. Passes went astray, defenders hesitated, and the midfield never once got a grip on the game.\n\n\n\nBy the time Haaland rolled in his second, it was no longer a contest. The Etihad roared, blue flags waved, and United\u2019s players trudged back into position with that familiar look of resignation. For City, it was a derby to remember. For United, one more long, bruising reminder of the gulf that now separates these two clubs.\n\n\n\nKey Moments & Goals\n\n\n\n\n18th minute: Phil Foden rose to head home Jeremy Doku\u2019s precise cross, giving City the lead. It was Foden\u2019s seventh Premier League goal against United in his career.\u00a0\n\n\n\n53rd minute: Haaland doubled City\u2019s lead. Doku made the run, slipped the pass, and Haaland chipped the keeper, Altay Bayindir, with composure.\u00a0\n\n\n\n68th minute: United lost the ball in midfield. Bernardo Silva picked it up, released Haaland on a fast break, and he finished cleanly. That sealed the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's #StatWrap \ud83d\udd22\ud83e\udd1d @okx pic.twitter.com/ZKzTU4NXC6\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity) September 14, 2025\n\n\n\n\nMetricManchester CityManchester UnitedPossession~45-51%\u00a0~55-60%\u00a0Shots on target / attemptsHigher volume & quality chances, including Haaland\u2019s post and multiple clear chances\u00a0Few meaningful chances; some long-range efforts; Benjamin Sesko forced a save but overall ineffective in final third\u00a0Youthful lineupsBoth sides had average ages under ~26 years; City more cohesive under pressure\u00a0Historic firsts / recordsHaaland scored his 50th goal in 50 home Premier League games for City. Only Alan Shearer did it faster (47 games).\u00a0\n\n\n\nThese numbers tell the story: City were efficient, dangerous, and composed. United, by contrast, were sloppy, reactive and lacked cutting edge.\n\n\n\nSource: ESPN\n\n\n\nWhat Went Wrong for Manchester United\n\n\n\n1. Defensive Errors & Turnovers\n\n\n\nUnited committed key mistakes in defensive transitions. Harry Maguire, under pressure, lost possession for City\u2019s third goal. Their backline struggled with movement off the ball, especially when City switched flanks via Doku and Silva.\u00a0\n\n\n\n2. Lack of Sharpness in Attack\n\n\n\nUnited\u2019s forwards hardly troubled City\u2019s defence. Benjamin Sesko\u2019s shot was saved by a debutant Gianluigi Donnarumma, but aside from that, chances were rare. Their buildup was often slow, too predictable, and easily intercepted. United did have some half chances, but nothing consistent enough to force City\u2019s goalkeepers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Midfield Overrun\n\n\n\nUnited\u2019s midfield failed to impose control. City dominated possession (around 60-61%), meaning United were chasing the game. They lacked cohesion between their defensive and attacking midfield units. Passes under pressure frequently went astray, and City\u2019s Rodri, Silva, and Doku repeatedly exploited these lapses.\u00a0\n\n\n\n4. Managerial & Tactical Missteps\n\n\n\nRuben Amorim\u2019s side looked unprepared for City\u2019s intensity and pressing. The use of wide areas was limited, and overlapping runs were poorly tracked. There seemed to be insufficient plan B once the initial tactical approach was broken. Substitutions came too late to alter the pattern of domination.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSource: The Busby Babe\n\n\n\nStandout Players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErling Haaland was, unsurprisingly, Man of the Match. His two goals were clinical, and his threat constantly pinned back United\u2019s central defenders. He also hit the post in one chance, showing he was close to a hat-trick.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil Foden, making just his second Premier League start of the season, delivered when it mattered. His header was precise; he showed movement and creativity in tight spaces. When shifted into a more central attacking role for this game, he justified the decision.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Doku also deserves credit, his two assists, dangerous runs down the flank, and ability to press United defenders unsettled them throughout.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma, making his Premier League debut for City, kept a clean sheet. He made at least one spectacular save (from Sesko) and was composed under pressure.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSource: The Analyst\n\n\n\nImplications & Outlook\n\n\n\nThis dominant win is more than just bragging rights. For City, it\u2019s a momentum boost after two losses before the international break, putting them back in the mix at the top of the table.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor United, the loss magnifies early-season concerns. With only 4 points from 4 games (win, draw, two losses), they are off to their poorest Premier League start since 1992-93. The defensive frailties, shaky midfield control, and lack of creativity need urgent fixing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSource: Sky Sports\n\n\n\nIn The \u201cEnd\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cManchester is Blue\u201d isn\u2019t hyperbole. The performance, the scoreline, the stats all point to City\u2019s complete superiority in this derby. From Foden\u2019s opener to Haaland\u2019s ruthlessness in front of goal, City executed their plan to near perfection. United, meanwhile, were exposed, especially in defence and midfield, and left with too many questions. As the season progresses, City will look to build on this. United must regroup and quickly.\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nLakshya Sen Clinches Silver at Hong Kong Open 2025 in Thrilling Badminton Final\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates, and\u00a0stay tuned!\n",

Kuldeep picked up three wickets, including Hasan Nawaz and Mohammad Nawaz in quick succession. Axar\u2019s variations removed Zaman and Agha, breaking the backbone of Pakistan\u2019s batting. Only Shaheen Afridi\u2019s late hitting, 33 not out from 16 balls, gave the total some respect. Still, 127 for nine in 20 overs was far below par in modern T20 cricket.\n\n\n\nPakistan\u2019s batting lacked intent. None of their top-order batters crossed 40, and their middle order folded under pressure. With only nine boundaries struck in the innings, they looked subdued and hesitant against India\u2019s balanced attack.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Bowlers Show Class\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s bowlers delivered with discipline and variety. Bumrah, as always, was sharp with the new ball, taking two wickets and conceding just 28 runs. Pandya, trusted with the opening over, struck early and returned figures of 1 for 34.\n\n\n\nThe real damage came from spin. Kuldeep\u2019s 3 for 18 highlighted his growing role as a match-winner in T20s. Varun Chakaravarthy bowled with control, taking 1 for 24. Axar Patel, with 2 for 18, maintained pressure by not allowing Pakistan to rotate strike. Even part-timer Abhishek Sharma contributed with a tidy over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe combined effort left Pakistan chasing survival rather than setting a target. With every bowler chipping in, India showed the depth that defines championship teams.\n\n\n\nSKY Leads a Confident Chase\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s reply was aggressive from the start. Abhishek Sharma showed intent by hitting Shaheen Afridi for a boundary off the first ball. Though he and Shubman Gill fell early to Saim Ayub, India never looked in trouble.\n\n\n\nCaptain Suryakumar Yadav anchored the innings with a composed 47 not out off 37 balls. His knock mixed patience with power, capped by a slogsweep six to finish the match. Tilak Varma chipped in with 31, while Shivam Dube\u2019s unbeaten cameo of 10, including a big six, ensured the chase ended in style at 131 for three in 15.5 overs.\n\n\n\nSaim Ayub was Pakistan\u2019s lone bowling highlight, taking all three wickets for 35 runs. However, support from the rest was absent. Abrar Ahmed and Shaheen Afridi failed to build pressure, conceding over eight runs an over. India\u2019s batters played with freedom, reflecting confidence in their approach.\n\n\n\nThe Wider Picture\n\n\n\nThis win was not just about points in Group A of the Asia Cup. It was another chapter in India\u2019s recent dominance over Pakistan in the shortest format. The gulf in class was clear\u2014India\u2019s spinners outbowled Pakistan\u2019s, and their batting was calmer under pressure.\n\n\n\nThe absence of senior names like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli did not weaken India. Instead, it gave space for younger players like Abhishek and Tilak to show promise, while SKY led with maturity. On the other side, Pakistan\u2019s failure to build partnerships again raised questions about their batting depth and strategy.\n\n\n\nFor fans, the lack of post-match handshakes told its own story. The rivalry remains intense, but the cricket showed one team composed and the other searching for answers.\n",

The 2024 World Cup saw them qualify for the semifinals and defeat Australia for the first time. This Asia Cup will be the perfect opportunity to pull off an upset and finally get their hands on a trophy.\n\n\n\nAfghanistan sports an elite spin bowling unit with franchise stars such as Noor Ahmed and Rashid Khan. With mystery spinners galore, the slow, gripping pitches of Dubai should give them enough aid to turn the tournament in their favor. Yet, Afghanistan still need to work on their batting and their aggression to take out teams like Pakistan, Srilanka and India in the Asia Cup,\n\n\n\nThe strike rate issue\n\n\n\nIn an era of role players and boundary hitting in T20s, Afghanistan is still trying to play anchors who accumulate in the middle overs and accelerate towards the death. They have a lack of batters who can accelerate freely without it leading to collapses. The Jonathan Trott-led team has its core around anchor batters who can drag the score to a par total.\n\n\n\nTeamStrike rateAverageAfghanistan116.2419.63India148.5129.35Sri Lanka128.2521.38Pakistan128.8120.62Bangladesh120.4721.52\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s main strategy is scoring a par score and then trying to defend it\n\n\n\nAfghanistan has a significantly lower batting average and batting strike rate than other Asian test nations. As of late, we have seen batting sides swap out anchors for role players in top sides around the world because success in T20 batting essentially revolves around scoring the most boundaries and losing the fewest wickets in the process.\n\n\n\nBatters like Ibrahim Zadran and Azmatullah Omarzai take time to start their innings, set themselves in and start hitting after. There is a lack of batters in the Afghan batting order who can attack bowlers from the get-go and hit as many boundaries as batters from other teams are regularly hitting. Afghanistan\u2019s batters have hit 414 fours and 218 sixes to India\u2019s 776 fours and 472 sixes since 2023.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfghanistan needs to devise a strategy where they can consistently score above-par scores so their bowlers have more of a chance to defend their totals more consistently. Rashid Khan\u2019s performance has been through a slight dip over the last IPL, and if Afghanistan wants to be a consistent team, they have to find more ways to win matches than relying on their spinners on every occasion.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBowling and fielding\n\n\n\nWhile Afghanistan\u2019s bowling unit is what keeps them competitive in recent years, they have to ensure that more talent keeps coming through the pipeline. Afghan stars such as Mohammed Nabi, Rashid Khan, and Noor Ahmed have travelled the world around franchise leagues and gathered critical cricketing experience that helps them succeed in knockout tournaments.\n\n\n\nYet, for their bowlers to have maximum efficiency, they have to improve their fielding and hold onto tough catches and capitalize on run-out chances. This means that Afghanistan has to step up their professionalism as a cricketing side for holistic improvement in the vein of top international sides such as India or Australia.\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s growth as a cricketing side in recent years has seen many occasions where they managed to pull out \u2018upsets.\u2019 They have to improve themselves into a well-rounded side so that they can bring home silverware and finally outgrow the \u2018underdog\u2019 tag.\n\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 \n\n\n\n\nAsia Cup 2025 Match 6: India and Pakistan Gear Up for Another Thriller in Dubai\n\n\n\nTwo Bold Paths, One Goal: Ashes and T20 World Cup\u2014England Eyes 2025 Ashes Glory, South Africa Prepares for T20 World Cup\n\n\n\nHow is South Africa rebuilding their batting order?\n\n",

The Indian shuttler went down to China\u2019s Li Shi Feng in the men\u2019s singles final of the Hong Kong Open 2025, losing 21-15, 21-12 at the Coliseum on Sunday.\n\n\n\nA Week That Reminded Everyone of Lakshya Sen\u2019s Talent\n\n\n\nSen hadn\u2019t reached a big final in a while, so just getting here felt like progress. The way he played through the week had shades of the 2022 Commonwealth Games champion people remember.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe beat HS Prannoy early in the draw and later pushed aside Ayush Shetty, who has been making waves as India\u2019s next prospect. But the real highlight was the semifinal against Chou Tien-Chen, the experienced Taiwanese. Sen edged him out in two nerve-wracking games, 23-21, 22-20  a result that showed he still has that stubborn fighting edge when the rallies get long. \n\n\n\nSource: Indian Express\n\n\n\nThat win alone gave fans hope he could upset Li in the final.\n\n\n\nThe Final That Slipped Away\n\n\n\nFor a few minutes, it looked like it might happen. Sen flew out to a 4-0 lead in the opening game, catching Li off guard with sharp smashes and early interceptions at the net. The crowd buzzed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut badminton can turn quickly. Once Li adjusted, the momentum shifted. He slowed the rallies, forced Sen into lifts, and took control at the mid-game interval, leading 11-10. From there, Li barely gave him an inch. Sen kept trying the big shots, but the errors came too often. First game done: 21-15. \n\n\n\nSource: Tribune India\n\n\n\nThe second game was almost a replay. Sen raced to 4-1, again pushing the pace. Again Li clawed back. One seven-point burst from the Chinese completely deflated Sen\u2019s momentum. From 4-1 up to 4-8 down, the Indian never really recovered. The end came fast 21-12  with Li sealing it on a net winner that Sen couldn\u2019t even move for. \n\n\n\nSource: India Today\n\n\n\nWhat the Numbers Say\n\n\n\nLooking at the stats, the story is clear:\n\n\n\n\nSen led twice early but couldn\u2019t hold it.\n\n\n\nUnforced errors hurt badly, especially in the second game.\n\n\n\nLi dominated net play, usually Sen\u2019s comfort zone.\n\n\n\nLonger rallies went China\u2019s way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSen actually won the first four points of both games but then lost 42 of the next 65. That swing alone explains how the match slipped.\n\n\n\nNot All Bad News\n\n\n\nEven in defeat, there are positives. Sen made his first Super 500 final in nearly two years. He beat a top-10 player in Chou Tien-Chen. He looked sharper, lighter on his feet, and more confident than he has for months.\n\n\n\nThe rivalry with Li Shi Feng also has history. This was their 14th meeting, dating back to junior days. Li leads the head-to-head, but Sen has beaten him before. Sunday\u2019s loss just showed the gap in consistency, not talent. \n\n\n\nSource: Indian Express\n\n\n\nA Hard Day for Indian Badminton\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only Sen who came close. In men\u2019s doubles, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty also fell short. They took the opening game 21-19 but couldn\u2019t close it out, losing to China\u2019s Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang in three games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo finals, two silvers. Not the fairytale finish fans wanted, but still a sign India is competing at the sharp end of world badminton. \n\n\n\nSource: Times of India\n\n\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\n\n\nFor Sen, this silver is a step in the right direction. He\u2019s only 24, and his best badminton is still ahead of him. The takeaway is simple: cut down the errors, stay composed after strong starts, and keep pushing the top names.\n\n\n\n\nLakshya Sen moves up 3 places into the ranking as WR 17 owing to his Runner Up finish at the Hong Kong OpenSatChi move up 2 places and will now be ranked WR 7 after a Runner Up finish at the Hong Kong Open pic.twitter.com/39r50mzkue\u2014 Just Badminton (@BadmintonJust) September 14, 2025\n\n\n\n\nIf he keeps this up, a gold medal isn\u2019t far away. Hong Kong 2025 may not have ended in celebration, but it did remind everyone that Lakshya Sen is very much still in the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nKhalid Jamil Effect Straight Away: India Clinch Bronze at CAFA Nations Cup 2025\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates, and\u00a0stay tuned!\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe cricketing world is ready for the explosive India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 Group A match on Sept 14 at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. This T20 fixture is the jewel of the eight-team tournament and is certainly steeped in anticipation and controversy.  \n\n\n\nThe on-field tussle is likely to be full of fireworks, while tensions off the field and fan boycotts have led to a flurry of commentary on social media platforms, which increases the stakes for the rivalry.\n\n\n\nTournament Context and Stakes\n\n\n\nHosted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) but staged in the UAE due to geopolitical uncertainty, the Asia Cup 2025 is an important precursor to the T20 World Cup 2026. \n\n\n\nIf both India and Pakistan make it to the Super Four and final, they could play each other up to three times, which makes this group stage clash quite an important early fight for bragging rights and initial form.\n\n\n\nIndia, the defending champions and eight-time winners of the Asia Cup, come in as the favorites after a convincing nine-wicket victory over the UAE in their opening clash, where their bowling attack, led by Kuldeep Yadav\u2019s four-wicket haul, bowled the hosts out for just 57 runs. \n\n\n\nConversely, Pakistan will come into this match riding some recent success, having showcased their mix of youth and experience in the recent T20I Tri-Series win over Afghanistan and the UAE in Sharjah under the new captaincy of Salman Agha. Only time will tell how both teams handle the pressure as they set out to re-establish regional superiority.\n\n\n\nPolitical and emotional context\n\n\n\nThe match has stirred intense discussion in India, exacerbated by the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people, and India\u2019s retaliation of Operation Sindoor. \n\n\n\nPlatforms such as X are flooded with #BoycottIndvsPak and #BoycottAsiaCup hashtags, indicating fans\u2019 discontent. A Reddit thread with more than 690 votes was calling for a mass boycott, with participants condemning BCCI for even considering playing Pakistan and invoking patriotism and the lives of soldiers.\n\n\n\nThe India-Pakistan clash takes place in a sensitive moment following a four-day armed conflict in May 2025, ending only with an internationally mediated ceasefire. Public sentiment in India remains raw, and while calls for a boycott were rejected, the BCCI just followed the Indian government policy to allow participation in multi-nation tournaments. \n\n\n\nSeparating Pakistan from cricket will be hard for the majority of the fans and experts who offered ideas on how to separate the cricket to ease tensions, but one cannot separate the emotional part from the cricket contest; it is still about the cricket, and they will be able to separate the cricket from the atmosphere and context matters.\n\n\n\nTeam analysis and key players\n\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n\nIndia has a strong team under the captaincy of Suryakumar Yadav, and other than superstars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, who chose to retire after winning the 2024 T20 World Cup, this team has done quite well. India just completed a 4-1 victory over England in the T20I series, indicating that India is a strong team. In their last 20 T20Is, India have lost three times.\n\n\n\nBatting: Abhishek Sharma (193 strike rate in T20s) and vice-captain Shubman Gill are an exciting combination at the top of the order. Surya, capable of 360-degree strokeplay, will spearhead the middle order with Tilak Varma and Sanju Samson, while Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube will provide explosive finishes.\n\n\n\nBowling: Jasprit Bumrah is back from injury and is leading a dangerous pace attack, supported by Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana. Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, and Axar Patel will be the spin options, with Kuldeep\u2018s form (four wickets against the UAE) could be a major weapon.\n\n\n\nX-Factor: Abhishek Sharma\u2019s aggressive batting and ability to attack spin could be a big asset on the slower pitches in Dubai.\n\n\n\nPakistan\n\n\n\nPakistan is in transition under Salman Agha\u2019s captaincy, with Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan not available. Their recent Tri-Series win, along with Mohammad Nawaz\u2019s hat-trick, demonstrates that they want to be playing aggressive cricket. Ranked eighth in the world, Pakistan\u2019s spin-heavy attack is more suited to UAE conditions.\n\n\n\nBatting: Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan get things started, with Fakhar Zaman and Hasan Nawaz offering explosive options in the middle. Salman Agha and Mohammad Haris provide depth, while Mohammad Nawaz provides the middle order with his all-round contributions.\n\n\n\nBowling: Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf lead the pace attack, while Sufiyan Muqeem\u2019s left-arm wrist-spin (25 wickets in 17 T20Is) is a major threat. Abrar Ahmed\u2019s mystery spin is an added element of unpredictability.\n\n\n\nX-Factor: Sufiyan Muqeem\u2019s ability to turn the ball both ways could cause problems for India\u2019s middle order on the spin-friendly surfaces in Dubai.\n\n\n\nPitch conditions and prediction\n\n\n\nThe pitch generally gives way slightly to spinners due to the slow and low conditions, which previously took time to use up runs, making it challenging for batsmen. From recent matches, it seems a par score would be around 160-170. If dew descends, it will advantage the team chasing in the evening contest. \n\n\n\nPlayers will have to endure extreme heat and humidity in September, but the 8:00 PM IST start time means a long day of humidity spent playing in the heat.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s form, along with their 10-3 T20I record against Pakistan, put them in the driving seat, but Pakistan\u2019s spin, coupled with their familiarity with Dubai, will present the biggest challenges to India\u2019s victory. \n\n\n\nTherefore, expect a very tight contest, possibly conceding to India. Regardless of the boycott, global viewership remains high as the match is streamed on SonyLIV and broadcast on Sony Sports, meaning there are also fans supporting the players that address cricket\u2019s true essence and unifying principle despite the noise.\n\n\n\n\n",

It was a significant stride in regional competition as well as towards those countries aiming at closing the divide with the elite footballing countries.\n\n\n\nThe tournament was also held in conjunction with the 10th anniversary of the Central Asian Football Association (CAFA) which was marking 10 years of regional cooperation in football development. In the beginning, Malaysia was going to be a part of it, but dropped out on 15 July 2025, citing logistical and player availability concerns. \n\n\n\nIndia was called in as a substitute and with this invitation, Blue Tigers got the chance of playing on a great international platform. India was confirmed in the All-India Football Federation (AIFF) a few weeks to the start of the tournament, in late July.\n\n\n\nThe tournament was organized into two sets of four teams. The matches of the group stage were held in three stadiums: in Tajikistan, the Hisor Central Stadium (20,000 seats), in Uzbekistan, the Milliy Stadium and Pakhtakor Central Stadium (40,000 and 35,000 seats, respectively). The structure enabled any team to have three group games, then knockouts, where there would be semi-finals, third place playoff and final.\n\n\n\nThe tournament was not just about the medals, but it was an orienting ground towards the AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers, which meant that the teams had to polish their strategies, experiment with player formations and enhance the dynamics of their squads. This was of special concern to India, which with newly appointed head coach, Khalid Jamil, took the tournament as an opportunity to experiment, learn and gaining confidence.\n\n\n\nThe final rankings were historic. Uzbekistan became the winner as they won the gold medal by beating Iran in the final by the slightest margin of 1-0 in extra time. The traditional Asian football powerhouse Iran took the silver, with India taking the bronze for the first time as they appeared on the podium in this event. \n\n\n\nThe third-place playoff victory over Oman was through a dramatic penalty shootout where goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saved the nation with vital saves.\n\n\n\nThe format of the tournament, intense rivalry, and equal groupings gave a combination of high stakes games and tactical encounters with a combination of experience and youthful vigor. \n\n\n\nThe incident cemented the role of regional collaboration and rivalry in improving the level of football among Central and South Asia. To India, it acted as a test run and a boost of confidence as it became the foundation of the future road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Stage & Knockout Rounds: India\u2019s Journey to the Bronze Medal\n\n\n\nThe tournament was inspirational to the Indian Football Team. India, ranked 127th in FIFA in April 2025, was placed in Group B with Tajikistan, Iran and Afghanistan, and was the lowest-ranked team in the group. Nevertheless, the Blue Tigers displayed perseverance, tactical discipline and stamina which left impressions not only on fans but also on analysts. India during the tenure of Khalid Jamil was not only adopted to a strategic, patient style of play and in the process, the focus was on possession-based play, quick passing, and disciplined defending.\n\n\n\nGroup Stage Matches\n\n\n\nMatch 1 \u2013 India vs Afghanistan (29 August, Hisor)India\u2019s campaign began on a high note, with a 1-0 win over Afghanistan. The match was a closely contested affair, with both teams probing for openings. The breakthrough came through a set-piece, where Udanta Singh capitalized on a loose ball inside the penalty area. India held on to their lead, showing composure and solid defending, securing crucial early points.\n\n\n\nMatch 2 \u2013 India vs Iran (1 September, Hisor)Facing Iran, ranked 18th globally, proved to be a stern test. Iran\u2019s superior experience, quick passing, and disciplined structure overwhelmed the Blue Tigers. Despite defending valiantly for long stretches, India succumbed to a 3-0 defeat. However, the team learned valuable lessons about pressing, defensive organization, and maintaining shape under pressure.\n\n\n\nMatch 3 \u2013 India vs Tajikistan (4 September, Hisor)In their final group match, India staged a spirited comeback against Tajikistan. With a fast start and well-coordinated attacks, India scored twice, one through a long throw that led to a defensive error and another from a swift counterattack. Despite conceding a late goal, India\u2019s 2-1 win secured their place in the semi-finals, marking an impressive recovery and demonstrating adaptability.\n\n\n\nKnockout Stage\n\n\n\nSemi-final \u2013 India vs Iran (6 September, Milliy Stadium)India\u2019s semi-final match was a tough outing. Iran\u2019s tactical discipline and depth proved overwhelming, handing India a 4-1 defeat. Nevertheless, India\u2019s lone goal, scored by Muhammed Uvais, highlighted the team\u2019s spirit and attacking potential. The defeat provided insights that would later help India regroup for the third-place playoff.\n\n\n\nThird-Place Playoff \u2013 India vs Oman (8 September, Hisor)India\u2019s finest hour arrived in the third-place match against Oman. After a hard-fought 1-1 draw, the match proceeded to penalties. In a nail-biting shootout, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu became the hero, saving the decisive penalty to hand India a 3-2 win. This victory secured the bronze medal and was celebrated as a landmark achievement in India\u2019s football history.\n\n\n\nRoad to the Third Place\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s performance throughout the tournament was built on collective effort, discipline, and strategic gameplay. While individual brilliance occasionally shone through, it was the team\u2019s unity and resilience that defined their success.\n\n\n\nEmerging from the group stage as underdogs, India displayed tactical maturity, mental toughness, and growth, qualities that will serve them well in the upcoming Asian Cup qualifiers and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal Scorers, Awards & Key Statistics\n\n\n\nThe 2025 CAFA Nations Cup was full of technical duels, group goals, and individual excellence and a few players proved their worth to the team. At the end of the tournament, prizes of excellence in performance, fair play, and goalkeeping were awarded, which also showed how all the involved nations showed the competitive spirit and professional conduct.\n\n\n\nTop Goal Scorers\n\n\n\nThe tournament\u2019s Top Goalscorer was Igor Sergeev of Uzbekistan, who scored 3 goals across the group and knockout stages. His combination of intelligent positioning and clinical finishing made him a nightmare for defenders. Sergeev\u2019s ability to time his runs and exploit space in the box was a decisive factor in Uzbekistan\u2019s title run.\n\n\n\nIn second place among goal scorers was Khojiakbar Alijonov, also from Uzbekistan, who scored 2 crucial goals, including the match-winner in the final against Iran. His composed play under pressure earned him the Best Player of the Tournament award.\n\n\n\nFor India, Udanta Singh and Muhammed Uvais emerged as key contributors. Udanta\u2019s composure in front of goal against Afghanistan and his leadership in the third-place playoff showcased his experience and versatility. Meanwhile, Uvais\u2019s long throws created multiple scoring opportunities and helped turn possession into attack, especially in the knockout rounds.\n\n\n\nIran\u2019s Payam Niazmand, despite conceding goals in multiple games, earned the Best Goalkeeper award for his reflex saves and command of the defensive third. His performances against teams like Uzbekistan and India were noteworthy, illustrating resilience in high-pressure situations.\n\n\n\nOther Awards\n\n\n\n\nFair Play Award: Tajikistan received the Fair Play Award for their disciplined and respectful play throughout the tournament.\n\n\n\nBest Emerging Player: This accolade went to India\u2019s Muhammed Uvais, whose long throws and energetic midfield presence were a revelation and a testament to India\u2019s scouting and player development system.\n\n\n\n\nGoal Analysis\n\n\n\nScoring in this tournament took place through various events such as set pieces, counterattacks as well as defensive lapses. Uzbekistan took advantage of rapid changes whereas Iran employed more possession-oriented tactics, keeping the ball in the middle of the field and finding loopholes on the defense. India, however, paid attention to organized defense, fast counter attacks and long passes that disorganized the defensive lines of the opponents.\n\n\n\nStatistics at a Glance\n\n\n\n\nTotal Goals Scored: 36\n\n\n\nMatches Played: 14\n\n\n\nAverage Goals per Match: 2.57\n\n\n\nMost Clean Sheets: Uzbekistan (4 matches)\n\n\n\nMost Fouls Conceded: Afghanistan\n\n\n\nPenalty Shootouts: 1 (India vs Oman third-place playoff)\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s tally of 4 goals across five matches was a modest but encouraging return, especially given their status as tournament newcomers. The defensive structure, combined with set-piece ingenuity, allowed them to stay competitive even against higher-ranked teams.\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n\nThe CAFA Nations Cup emphasised not only the superiority of Uzbekistan, but also the consistency of Iran and the rapid development of India with a new coach. It was also a testing ground for upcoming players in the tournament, as there was a mixture of experienced players and potential stars performing in an unforgettable manner.\n\n\n\nAll these personal and group performances established the theme of what India hopes to become in continental championships and the experiences of both victory and failure are lessons they can apply to their future efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Road Ahead: Preparation for the AFC Asian Cup 2027\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s performance in the CAFA Nations Cup 2025, culminating in a historic bronze medal, is more than a celebratory achievement, it is a steppingstone toward larger continental ambitions. With AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers looming, India\u2019s focus is now on translating the momentum from the tournament into sustained performance on a bigger stage.\n\n\n\nUpcoming Fixtures\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s next major challenge is the qualification process for the AFC Asian Cup 2027, which will test their tactical maturity, fitness levels, and squad depth. The qualifiers are scheduled as follows:\n\n\n\n\n9 October 2025: India vs Singapore (Home)\n\n\n\n14 October 2025: Singapore vs India (Away)\n\n\n\n18 November 2025: Bangladesh vs India (Away)\n\n\n\n31 March 2026: India vs Hong Kong (Home)\n\n\n\n\nThese fixtures present a balanced mix of home-and-away encounters, each requiring different approaches; home matches demand attacking intent and controlling possession, while away games necessitate disciplined defending and counterattacking efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe CAFA Experience\n\n\n\nThe CAFA Nations Cup provided India with the insights in their tactical and psychological preparedness. Following the philosophy of collective resilience and positional discipline as spread by Coach Khalid Jamil is likely to be transferred into the qualifiers. The use of long throws, set pieces and organised defense that served so well against the Central Asian opposition may be modified to plan matches against the technically skilled players such as Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nSquad Development\n\n\n\nOne of the important results of the tournament is the exposure given to the younger players such as Muhammed Uvais and Udanta Singh. As the old warhorses took a back seat, the bench strength of India was put to test and new leaders were born. This should be encouraging to the long-term squad planning as the AIFF will be able to invest in youth development without losing the experience of the players as mentors.\n\n\n\nAlso, the tournament provided the opportunity to experiment with midfield and defense combinations. The tactical experiments that Jamil tries, like using long throws to attack, will probably be improved using CAFA knowledge.\n\n\n\nChallenges Ahead\n\n\n\nThe way to the Asian glory will not be smooth though. India needs to work on such aspects as management of fitness, sustaining squad harmony and dealing with in-game transitions when pressure mounts. Those who oppose such as Singapore, Bangladesh and Hong Kong will analyse performances of CAFA of India and seek to take advantage of any defensive weaknesses or over-use of the set pieces.\n\n\n\nIt will also be important to keep the consistency of attack patterns and improve the goal conversion rates. India performed reasonably in terms of shot accuracy and the creation of chances in the CAFA tournament, but the performances should be refined when playing the higher-ranked teams.\n\n\n\nOptimism and Realism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CAFA Nations Cup bronze medal has provided faith to the players, fans, and even to the administration. It is not only a victory, but also a new initiative towards a strong and competitive national team. The leadership of Jamil along with tactical discipline and youth development provides India with an effective way of becoming a formidable figure in Asia.\n\n\n\nWith less than a month to the qualifiers, India will have the difficulty of keeping a balance between the lessons of the Central Asia and the initiative of the tactics and ensuring that each game counts towards continental recognition and development.\n",

The Asia Cup is going on, and during this Asia Cup buzz, fans are also excited for the Ashes and T20 World Cup. South Africa is building a fresh, young team, hoping to do great at the 2026 T20 World Cup. But England wants payback against Australia in the Ashes.\n\n\n\nThe Red Ball Mission: England Getting Ready for the Ashes\n\n\n\nThe Ashes and T20 World Cup are big deals for England\u2019s cricket scene. The team always goes all out for the Ashes\u2014it\u2019s a classic, super-tough Test series. Right now, the coaches are pushing everyone to get them ready for the series, which kicks off in Perth on November 21, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant players are returning with enthusiasm. After suffering a shoulder injury, Test captain Ben Stokes is back to hitting and is making a concerted effort to get fit for games. His bowling might take a bit longer to get back to full speed, though. On the bright side, Mark Wood is getting better after his knee surgery and is getting closer to being back on the team.\n\n\n\nJofra Archer is a huge plus for England. He just grabbed four wickets for eighteen runs in a key game against South Africa. Everyone thinks his return will really help England\u2019s bowling in the next Ashes series. The Ashes and T20 World Cup\u2014both tournaments are important for the England team. Let\u2019s see what happens next!\n\n\n\nThe White Ball Mission: South Africa is preparing for T20 World Cup\n\n\n\nFans are excited for one of the two biggest cricket tournaments, the Ashes and the T20 World Cup. And in this ongoing buzz, South Africa is focused on getting ready for the next ICC T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in early 2026. Their plan? Mixing up the team and seeing what some fresh blood can do.\n\n\n\nThe team\u2019s counting on some fresh faces, like Lhuan-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis, who are getting ready for bigger jobs. The selectors are feeling good that these guys will bring some spark to South Africa\u2019s batting and attack, especially after seeing how they\u2019ve been playing in T20 matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa is getting ready for some cricket matches! In January and February 2026, they\u2019re playing five Twenty20 matches against the West Indies to get the team in shape. After that, they\u2019re planning a three-way series with New Zealand and Zimbabwe. This is mainly to test out different players, give everyone some playing time, and try out new game plans.\n\n\n\nThe coach and selectors are keen on getting some younger players involved. They reckon it\u2019s a good moment to build a title-contending team and prep for upcoming world tournaments.\n\n\n\nThe Ashes and the T20 World Cup: What\u2019s the big deal?\n\n\n\nThe Ashes and T20 World Cup: The growing divergence in cricketing priorities is best illustrated by the disparity between South Africa\u2019s white-ball ambitions and England\u2019s Test-centric\u00a0strategy. For South Africa, they like young, quick learners on their team. England? We have seen in the past that England always tries to go with players with experience who stick to rules and can fight the old rivalries. The different formats need different plans. Ashes and the T20 World Cup are different in nature. T20 is about being quick and fun, while the Ashes is more about tradition and good technique.\n\n\n\nWhile England are gearing up for the Ashes in November, South Africa have got their eyes on the T20 World Cup, and after winning the WTC, South Africa\u2019s energy is high and their eyes are on the T20 World Cup. It\u2019s amusing how fans are hyped about totally different things at the same time. Expect loads of talk about the Ashes and T20 World Cup since everyone\u2019s getting ready for both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next cricket season should be a blast, packed with smart plays and unforgettable moments. South Africa is putting together a squad ready to rock in T20 cricket. England is also looking to prove they\u2019re still a force to be reckoned with when they play their old rivals.\n",

      "content_full": "\n2025 has been the year where South Africa has finally been able to erase the tag of \u2018Chokers\u2019 from their modern cricketing history after lifting the World Test Championship mace for the 2023-25 cycle. On top of that, they have gone on to clinch 2 successive ODI series away from home versus Australia and England, respectively, which is an indication of a return to form for South African top-order batting, which has been on the decline in recent years.\n\n\n\nAfter the departure of Kallis, Amla, and de Villiers, South African batting hit a slump that was reflected both in their ODI form and their red ball success. The new crop of players, such as Ryan Rickleton, Wiaan Mulder, and Matthew Breetzke, demonstrate how the future of South African batting may be a return to the glory of past world-beating teams that South Africa has had.\n\n\n\nThe top order\n\n\n\nSouth Africa has recently stuck with the opening pair of Markram and Rickleton. Both of them are T20 regulars in franchise leagues outside the world and are quite aggressive openers for both white-ball and red-ball cricket. Markram won the WTC final for South Africa with his century while chasing 282 in the 4th innings. Markram now averages 45.64 in the 4th innings and brought up his 3rd century in the 4th innings in the WTC final.\n\n\n\nMarkram\u2019s match factor for tests between 2024 and 2025 is 1.69, which means he has been 69% better than batters in his matches. Ryan Rickleton has accumulated a match factor of 1.78 during the same period. Ryan Rickelton\u2019s 259 against Pakistan put him on the map and steadied his spot in the South African top order. He still has to work on his consistency to ensure that his aggression brings the most returns for South African batting.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWiaan Mulder is South Africa\u2019s most recent experiment in the no. 3 role when it comes to test cricket, and he has taken to the role like a duck to water with his 367* against Zimbabwe earlier this year. In ODIs he has managed to contribute with some lower-order hitting and claim valuable wickets in the middle overs with his bowling. While Tony De Zorzi hasn\u2019t managed to announce himself as well as the other contenders, he is still a promising player with technical flair who only needs a run of scores to cement his place in the team.\n\n\n\nMiddle order\n\n\n\nMatthew Breetzke started his ODI career with a brilliant 150\n\n\n\nThe last WTC cycle was the peak of Temba Bavuma\u2019s batting, capped off by him leading from the front when he got South Africa their first major title in decades. His average was a whopping 59.25 during the last WTC cycle, and he is among the best No. 4s in test cricket currently. David Bedingham, who has been a red-ball specialist with an impressive First Class record, also provided valuable runs for them in the WTC final.\n\n\n\nTristan Stubbs has been inducted into their red ball team on the back of his white ball exploits. He is seen as an all-format player who came into the spotlight with his exploits for Delhi Capitals in the IPL. At No. 5, he is a new-age batter who loves playing freely in Test cricket in the vein of Rishabh Pant, Travis Head, or Harry Brook.\n\n\n\nMatthew Breezke has started in ODIs with almost Bradman-esque form, with five 50+ scores in his first five innings of ODI cricket. If given the chance, he\u2019d prove to be an asset to increase South African batting depth in test cricket as well.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe recent entrants into the South African side, namely Dewald Brevis and Lhuan Dre Pretorious, have taken the world by storm with their aggressive hitting in the IPL and SA20, respectively. With both of them getting handed test debuts against Zimbabwe recently, it is evident that CSA is looking at them as all-format players. Brevis and Pretorious have strike rates of 155.28 and 144.06, respectively, in T20s.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat is the way forward for South African batting?\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s batting core at the present moment is made up of multi-format players. With the exception of Bedingham and Verreyne, the other top-order and middle-order batters are not red-ball specialists. The recent inclusion of Brevis and Pretorious into red-ball setups is an indication that South Africa wants to build a batting core that can give them multi-format success.\n\n\n\nThe last era has been dominated by the wobble ball bowling, and batters have struggled to make runs on seam-friendly pitches of the WTC era. South Africa has an efficient bowling lineup that is quite capable of taking 20 wickets frequently. Hence, choosing batters who have had success in the white-ball format allows them to play with more freedom and get enough runs on the board, which their bowlers can then defend.\n\n\n\nWith one eye towards the 2027 ODI World Cup and looking to continue their domination into the next WTC cycle, Temba Bavuma and his men plan to rebuild their team centered around aggression, intent and a positive playing mindset when it comes to their batting.\n\n\n\n\n",

The victory boosted India\u2019s net run rate and displayed the strength of their bowling attack and explosive batting group.\n\n\n\nUAE\u2019s Batting Collapse: A Tale of Wickets Tumbling\n\n\n\nIndia won the toss and chose to field, meaning the UAE were under pressure right from the start with a very disciplined bowling effort. UAE captain Muhammad Waseem got off to an aggressive start with some initial boundaries that took UAE to 41/2 at the end of the powerplay, but what followed was a spectacular collapse as UAE battled to cope with India\u2019s varied attack. \n\n\n\nAlishan Sharafu fell first, when Jasprit Bumrah bowled a brilliant yorker in the fourth over, and then Muhammad Zohaib was caught off Varun Chakravarthy.\n\n\n\nThe middle order gave brief resistance. Rahul Chopra was out thanks to Kuldeep, and in a brutal over, he took another three wickets, including Waseem and Harshit Kaushik, knocking UAE down to 50/5. \u00a0\n\n\n\nDube wanted to the fun, and he took 3 wickets, including Asif, Dhruv, and Junaid Siddique in it. Axar trapped Simranjeet Singh; it was for Kuldeep to finish it off when he caught Haider Ali in the 13th over. The UAE\u2019s total of 57 was their lowest in T20Is, and the lowest total by any team ever against India in T20Is.\n\n\n\nThis collapse was a reflection of the UAE\u2019s inexperience against quality opposition. Despite some promise early from Waseem, who looked good against the seamers, the spin combination of Kuldeep and Chakravarthy took advantage of the spin-friendly track. \n\n\n\nThe humidity in Dubai may have contributed to a lack of clarity in thought, but the UAE\u2019s batters never seemed playful enough to adapt. They were guilty of some poor shot selection and failed to rotate the strike. By the innings break, India had already established their dominance and was in a position to chase quickly.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Bowling Masterclass: Kuldeep and Dube Shine\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s bowlers were the heroes, with Kuldeep Yadav providing a thrilling game-changing performance of 4/7, expertly tearing apart the UAE\u2019s middle order with his numerous variations and skill. Yadav\u2019s three-wicket over was significant, and he showed why he is now a top-tier player for India\u2019s T20 outfit.\n\n\n\n Dube, although primarily a batting all-rounder, was another wow factor bowler; he claimed 3/4 and exploited the weaknesses of the UAE batters. Bumrah was economical, with only six runs in his spell and chastened away a wicket, and Chakravarthy and Axar both provided good support with a wicket apiece.\n\n\n\nSuryakumar Yadav\u2019s decision to bat first meant they got some dividends, especially looking at the dew and the second innings. The bowling attack was smart with off-pace and spin-bowling, keeping the UAE batters guessing. \n\n\n\nThis performance shows the depth of how India strategized, picking both wrist-spinners, Kuldeep and Chakravarthy, and for this match, on a pitch that turned, was a masterstroke.\n\n\n\n For the UAE, the exposure for their bowlers would have been a rude awakening with lessons, though, highlighting developmental areas for improvement back in their domestic setup.\n\n\n\nExplosive Chase and Looking Ahead: India\u2019s Statement Win\n\n\n\nWith only 58 runs needed, India\u2019s openers Abhishek and Gill wasted little time in letting loose on the UAE bowlers. They played with freedom from the outset, hitting boundaries at will, and wrapped up the match in under five overs. Abhishek was particularly aggressive while Gill played with class and anchored the innings. India ended with 60/1 \u2013 slightly over the target due to the team doing most of the work.\n\n\n\n The one wicket that fell was most likely that of one of the openers, but the records show the only basis for argument is the nine-wicket winning margin, which clearly shows the one-sided nature of the match.\n\n\n\nThis victory puts India in an excellent position in Group A, with games like Pakistan on the horizon. It is unfortunate for the UAE to lose the match, but taking part in tournaments such as these will provide them with useful experience. \n\n\n\nThe captaincy of Suryakumar Yadav was pitch-perfect, and players like Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya didn\u2019t even have to bat, enabling them to save energy later in the series.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, India\u2019s comprehensive victory over the UAE in the Asia Cup 2025 opener reaffirms their status as favorites. With a blend of youth and experience, they look poised to defend their title. \n\n\n\nAs the tournament progresses, all eyes will be on how they handle sterner tests, but for now, this match was a perfect start- clinical, dominant, and entertaining.\n",

This milestone is an indicator of the strategic planning of the board, multiple sources of revenue and unmatched popularity of cricket in India.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \ud835\udc79\ud835\udc6c\ud835\udc77\ud835\udc76\ud835\udc79\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc7a \ud83d\udea8The BCCI reportedly holds a bank balance of INR 20,686 crore as of 12 months ago! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude31Since 2019, the board\u2019s revenue has increased significantly, with INR 14,627 crore added in the last five years alone! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\udfcf#BCCI #India #Cricket #Sportskeeda pic.twitter.com/mRDelAQcsB\u2014 Sportskeeda (@Sportskeeda) September 6, 2025 \n\n\n\nRegardless of this financial performance, the future of the board is exciting and uncertain given the increasing concerns about taxation, changes in regulations and sustainability of its revenue model.\n\n\n\nThe IPL at the Centre of BCCI\u2019s Bank Balance:\n\n\n\nThe Indian Premier League (IPL) is still the major contributor to the BCCI\u2019s bank balance and the spectacular financial achievement of the BCCI. Besides making it a fan favourite, the T20 league has turned out to be a powerful commercial force. The ability of the IPL to attract foreign broadcasting firms and sponsors has earned the BCCI the newfound revenues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IPL was in a position to purchase almost \u20b94,000 crore during the 2023-24 season through long-term sponsorship deals with businesses such as Tata Group, My11Circle, Ceat, and AngelOne, and this contributed toward increasing the BCCI\u2019s bank balance. These agreements have been a boost to the commercial power of the league and also gained revenue to a great extent for the board.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the brand value of the IPL expanded to 13% since 2009, when it stood at a paltry 2 billion, and in 2024, when it is projected to reach 12 billion. The Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), Mumbai Indians (MI), Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) teams representing Indian cricket have already reached the mark of a hundred million dollars, and this means that the sphere is becoming popular in the world arena.\n\n\n\nExpanding Outside of the IPL:\n\n\n\nThe IPL continues to contribute most to the BCCI\u2019s bank balance, yet the board has succeeded in diversifying its revenue streams. As it has been provided in the 2021-22 financial statement, the revenue and expenses as reported by the board were \u20b9 7,606 crore and \u20b9 3,064 crore, respectively. Such figures reflect wise management and budgeted spending in local and international cricketing.\n\n\n\nThe revenue of television rights, sponsorship deals and ICC revenue shares has strengthened the balance sheet of the BCCI. It also paid an income tax of \u20b9 1,159 crore in the 2021-22 financial year, which is 37% higher than the previous year, which refers to its commitment to transparency and compliance with the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernance and Leadership Encouraging Stability in Finance:\n\n\n\nThis expansion has been greatly aided by the BCCI\u2019s leadership. The board has taken a progressive stance under the direction of Jay Shah as secretary and Sourav Ganguly as president. To a large extent, the finances of this board have been moulded by their focus on expanding the sponsorships, maximising media rights deals, and effective financial management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides enhancing profitability, changes in governance and adequate investments at the right time have improved the resilience of the board to external shocks such as market volatility and the post-pandemic period.\n\n\n\nNew Challenges: Increasing Apprehensions Regarding Revenue and Regulation\n\n\n\nDespite these successes, rising tax and regulatory issues pose a threat to BCCI\u2019s bank balance. It is estimated that the cricket economy will lose almost \u20b97,000 crore as a result of the recent prohibition on money-based online gambling sites, particularly fantasy sports. The ban has pushed big sponsorship deals to be cancelled, such as the \u20b9625 crore deal with My11Circle to become the IPL sponsor and the \u20b9358 crore deal with Dream11 to become the Team India sponsor.\n\n\n\nThese incidences raise a serious question of the ability of the board to continue earning its income streams and adapting to the evolving regulatory frameworks without losing the involvement of its fans.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: A Plan for Long-Term Development\n\n\n\nThe BCCI is investigating new sponsoring and digital platforms to fight these concerns. Other partnerships with international broadcasting organisations, data analytics companies, and sports-technology startups are under consideration in order to create long-term value. Moreover, it is hoped that the BCCI\u2019s focus on women\u2019s cricket, local tourism and growth at the grassroots will help it to expand and develop a talent pool that will keep the sport of cricket growing long after.\n\n\n\nThe BCCI has made a name for itself in commercial prowess, and none other, as the financial records show that the BCCI\u2019s bank balance has grown to an incredible \u20b914,627 crore since the year 2019. Besides this being an indicator of the success of the IPL and other sources of revenue, a phenomenal \u20b920,686 crore bank balance demonstrates good leadership and vision.\n\n\n\nEven the most stable sports organisations are prone to external risks, as has been revealed by increasing worries about the regulation and taxation of the bank balance of the BCCI and the influence of sponsorship on the organisation.\n\n\n\nThe ability of the BCCI to adapt, evolve and innovate will play a significant role in ensuring the financial supremacy of the financial institution as cricket continues to captivate millions of individuals. With proper preparation, it is in a good position to withstand the hardships in the future and cement its position as the most powerful and rich cricketing organisation in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That approach delivered. A 2-1 win over Tajikistan set the tone, and the campaign closed with a tense penalty shootout victory against Oman that secured a bronze medal. For India, it was a rare podium finish on foreign soil. For Jamil, it was proof that his methods struck a chord immediately.\n\n\n\nSource: ESPN\n\n\n\nA Tactical Masterclass: Simple, Solid, Successful\n\n\n\nSet-Piece Strategy & Defensive Solidity\n\n\n\nJamil\u2019s approach was pragmatic. Against host Tajikistan, India scored both goals within 13 minutes using long throw-ins and crowded penalty-area chaos to devastating effect. Defender Anwar Ali crashed in the first, and Sandesh Jhingan followed up from Rahul Bheke\u2019s header after another well-delivered set-piece.\n\n\n\n\nA DEBUT TO REMEMBER IN THE #CAFANationsCup2025 \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3Khalid Jamil's #BlueTigers defeat hosts Tajikistan in the Group \ud83c\udd71\ufe0f opener \ud83d\udc4a#TJKIND #IndianFootball \u26bd pic.twitter.com/huCiy3Hw3i\u2014 Indian Football Team (@IndianFootball) August 29, 2025\n\n\n\n\nPost-goals, India dropped deep, absorbed pressure, and relied on their organized backline and goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu to steady the ship.\n\n\n\nGoalkeeper as Captain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGurpreet\u2019s inclusion was a bold call. Despite limited match time and a challenging season, Jamil reinstated him as captain and he responded in kind. His penalty save and multiple key interventions against Tajikistan underscored Jamil\u2019s confidence in experience.\n\n\n\nTournament Journey: Steady Build-Up to Podium Finish\n\n\n\nMatchResultHighlightsvs Tajikistan (Group B)2-1 winEarly goals from Anwar, Jhingan; Gurpreet\u2019s heroics in second half.\u00a0vs Afghanistan0-0 draw (clean sheet)Jamil\u2019s system held firm; disciplined defense held out.\u00a0vs Iran0-3 (Challenging fixture)Test of tactical limits; Iran\u2019s reputation looms large.\u00a0Bronze vs Oman1-1 draw (3-2 pens win)Udanta equalized in 80\u2019; Gurpreet saved three penalties in shoot-out.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAgainst Afghanistan\n\n\n\nIndia demonstrated defensive composure in a goalless draw, highlighting Jamil\u2019s focus on structure and discipline.\n\n\n\nThe Oman Thriller: Bronze Secured\n\n\n\nIn the third-place playoff, India conceded first but showed resilience. Udanta Singh headed home in the 80th minute to level. The game remained deadlocked through extra time, leading to penalties. Gurpreet rose again saving three sealing a historic bronze for India.\n\n\n\nSource: Republic World\n\n\n\nRoles Beyond the Numbers\n\n\n\nGurpreet Singh Sandhu (GK & Captain)\n\n\n\nReturned as captain and never looked back. Delivered clutch saves across matches including penalties and brought leadership and confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnwar Ali & Sandesh Jhingan (Defenders)\n\n\n\nPhysicality and aerial dominance featured prominently especially on set-pieces. Both scored in the Tajikistan match.\n\n\n\nMuhammed Uvais (Fullback Specialist)\n\n\n\nHis long throws were central to India\u2019s set-piece threat. Jamil\u2019s awareness of his unique skill played a critical part in those early goals.\n\n\n\nUdanta Singh (Substitute Hero)\n\n\n\nTurned the match on its head against Oman with his header equalizer, exhibiting the spirit Jamil has fostered across the squad.\n\n\n\nNo Dependence on Big Names\n\n\n\nWhat stood out most about Khalid Jamil\u2019s first tournament in charge was the way he broke from the old script. For too long, India had leaned on its familiar names, hoping their stature alone would carry results, only to end up with the same disappointments. Jamil didn\u2019t buy into that. He cut through reputations and went straight to players he believed could give him something on the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnwar Ali and Sandesh Jhingan were the backbone, throwing themselves into tackles and organising the back line. Muhammed Uvais, usually a quiet presence, became a weapon with his long throws that unsettled stronger opponents. And then there was Gurpreet Singh Sandhu brought back as captain when many thought his time had passed. He answered with match-saving stops and leadership that glued the team together. The squad looked different: hungrier, more connected, less weighed down by names and more defined by effort. That, more than the bronze medal, was Jamil\u2019s real statement.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Next? The Road Ahead\n\n\n\nThis CAFA Nations Cup serves as a proving ground ahead of the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. The group stage exit wasn\u2019t ideal India\u2019s FIFA ranking (hovering near 133) might dip but Jamil\u2019s tournament was more about building cohesion and testing depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, the looming clash with Iran underlined the need for adaptability beyond defensive rigidity. India\u2019s next focus: breaking out of low-block dominance, improving offensive creativity, and sustaining pressure against elite opponents.\n\n\n\nA Human Story, Real Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat resonates most is the human element a marshalling of experienced heads like Gurpreet and Jhingan, emerging heroes like Udanta, and a coach who trusted them to win with grit, not glamour. Khalid Jamil\u2019s methodology may feel old-school, but it delivered. And for India, that bronze medal in their CAFA debut isn\u2019t just hardware it\u2019s hope.\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nFrom History to Ruthless Dominance, Max Verstappen Conquers the Italian GP 2025\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates, and\u00a0stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n",

This time, though, the noise was silenced by one lap.\n\n\n\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f FASTEST LAP IN F1 HISTORY \u2b50\ufe0f#F1 #ItalianGP pic.twitter.com/UyULK6N1xh\u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) September 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\nVerstappen\u2019s 1:18.792 wasn\u2019t just pole position. It was the fastest lap in Formula 1 history, averaging a jaw-dropping 264.68 km/h. Norris came within a tenth. Piastri was just behind him. Yet somehow, Verstappen found the kind of margin that separates perfection from almost perfect.\n\n\n\nAnd at Monza, almost perfect doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\n\n\nSource: Race Fans\n\n\n\nSunday: When Calm Became Crushing\n\n\n\nPole at Monza isn\u2019t always a golden ticket. In fact, nobody had converted pole into victory here since 2019. The long straights and DRS trains often eat away at that advantage. But Verstappen had other plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorris got a lively start, and for a heartbeat, McLaren fans thought the race might swing their way. Verstappen absorbed the pressure, kept the Red Bull planted, and by lap ten had already started to stretch the gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the halfway mark, his lead looked comfortable. By the finish, it was brutal: nearly 20 seconds clear of Norris. To underline the point, he also grabbed the fastest lap late on. It was the kind of performance that strips rivals of excuses.\n\n\n\nSource: Reuters\n\n\n\nMcLaren: Speed Undone by Sloppiness\n\n\n\nThis race could easily have been McLaren\u2019s story. Their car was fast, their drivers sharp, and after qualifying it looked like they might finally cage the Red Bull. But when you\u2019re fighting Verstappen, everything has to be flawless.\n\n\n\n\nLAP 47 & 48/53Drama at McLaren \ud83e\udd2fPiastri pits first followed by Norris the next lap but it's a slow stop for the Briton and he loses track position to his title rival! #F1 #ItalianGP pic.twitter.com/yVcdgUdCif\u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) September 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\nNorris\u2019s pit stop was anything but. A sticky wheel nut added nearly six seconds to his stop, enough to shuffle him behind his teammate. Suddenly, Oscar Piastri was running second, and McLaren had a dilemma.\n\n\n\nWhat followed was awkward. The team told Piastri to let Norris through. He hesitated, pushed back, then finally gave way. Norris finished second, Piastri third, but the damage was done. Verstappen\u2019s win looked easy partly because McLaren made it so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in the championship picture? That matters. Piastri\u2019s lead shrank to 31 points. For a season that once looked like his to lose, the margin no longer feels safe.\n\n\n\nSource: MotorsportWeek\n\n\n\nFerrari: A Home Race Without Fireworks\n\n\n\nEvery September, Monza is painted red. Flags, smoke, chants it\u2019s Ferrari\u2019s weekend, no matter the results. But once again, the results didn\u2019t live up to the passion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Leclerc qualified fourth and stayed there. Lewis Hamilton, still finding his feet in Ferrari red, slipped down the order after grid penalties and could only recover to sixth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFerrari had gambled on a low-downforce setup to claw back time on the straights. Instead, they paid for it in the corners. Through the Lesmos and Ascari, the SF-25 slid where the Red Bull and McLaren stuck. On paper, fourth and sixth aren\u2019t disastrous. But at Monza, with thousands of fans singing your name, anything short of a podium feels hollow.\n\n\n\nSource: ScuderiaFans\n\n\n\nWhy Verstappen\u2019s Win Mattered More\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just another Verstappen victory.

Strategy, tyre management, execution there was no weak link.\n\n\n\n\nA slow pitstop for Lando pic.twitter.com/fcVLfuvGmj\u2014 Prayag (@prayag_) September 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\nContrast that with McLaren, who left Monza with questions about pit crew efficiency and team orders. Or Ferrari, who left with more questions than answers about their car\u2019s setup.\n\n\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\n\n\nChampionship battles aren\u2019t won on single weekends, but they can turn on them. For Piastri, Monza felt like a slip controlled, but costly. For Norris, it was another reminder that his best isn\u2019t quite enough when Verstappen is flawless.\n\n\n\nAnd for Ferrari? They\u2019ll regroup, but the gulf is still there. Home advantage, crowd energy, and history didn\u2019t bridge it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerstappen leaves Italy with momentum and with something more intangible: the aura that comes from not just winning, but doing so with ruthless efficiency. It\u2019s the kind of aura that wins championships.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nMonza loves drama, but this time the drama was over early. Once Verstappen hit his stride, there was no fight left at the front. McLaren blinked, Ferrari stumbled, and Verstappen turned speed into supremacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Temple of Speed had its champion, and his name is Max Verstappen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nTop 3 Potential Replacements for Gautam Gambhir as Head Coach of the Indian National Cricket Team\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates, and\u00a0stay tuned!\n",

      "content_full": "\nGautam Gambhir\u2019s tenure as coach has been anything but ideal, with India only winning 5 out of the 15 tests played in this period. While it is a side in transition, India has suffered a whitewash at home against New Zealand, tarnishing an unblemished 12-year-long home record on his watch.\n\n\n\nWhile his white ball fortunes have been favorable, with India winning the Champions trophy on his watch, his red ball fortunes have come up scarce, with India only winning 1 out of the 4 test series played during his tenure. With his record in mind, it may be time for India to start looking for the next Indian cricket team head coach in 2025. Here is a list of replacements that the Indian men\u2019s team may consider for India\u2019s upcoming red-ball and white-ball fixtures.\n\n\n\n1. VVS Laxman\n\n\n\nVVS Laxman has cemented his legacy as one of India\u2019s batting greats with some of the most memorable innings ever played by an Indian batter. Proclaimed \u2018The God of the 4th Innings,\u2019 he has gone about playing some of the finest fourth-inning knocks in the history of test cricket. He is the current Head of Cricket at the NCA Academy; he is also the head coach for the Under-19 and the India A teams.\n\n\n\nWith a fair amount of coaching experience in his resume and his work coaching the youngsters in the Under-19 setup, Laxman could prove to be Gautam Gambhir\u2019s replacement for this young Indian side and its youngsters who are coming up through the Under-19 or the developmental circuit. Laxman\u2019s familiarity with the Indian domestic setup means that he will be better at scouting and guiding talent and training them for the international level.\n\n\n\nWhile Gambhir\u2019s appointment as coach came on the back of his white ball success with Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2024, Laxman, like Dravid, will have coached the Under-19 side before coaching the National team, meaning that he will have already spent time coaching and guiding talent that will eventually make it into the international fold.\n\n\n\n2. Ricky Ponting\n\n\n\nPonting has coached Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings in the IPL\n\n\n\nOne of the most prolific batters from Australia and the third-highest run getter in test cricket, Ricky Ponting was also considered as an option for the head coach of the Indian Men\u2019s cricket team before Gautam Gambhir\u2019s appointment. This will break the tradition of former Indian cricketers being the head coach for the Indian men\u2019s team since Gary Kirsten.\n\n\n\nPonting has recently worked with the Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in the IPL. He has also coached teams in other franchise leagues, such as the Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket. His expertise about away conditions, especially in Australia and England, will prove to be an important asset for the Indian team, who have recently struggled on their away tours in the test format.\n\n\n\n3. Mahela Jayawardene\n\n\n\nMahela Jayawardene, along with Kumar Sangakkara, was the stalwart of the Sri Lankan middle order for decades. Jayawardene\u2019s batting was a technical masterclass, and he was at his best in home conditions in Sri Lanka. Jayawardene\u2019s familiarity with subcontinental conditions may help the Indian team build up a fortress in subcontinental conditions.\n\n\n\nMahela Jayawardene has coached the Mumbai Indians since 2017 and also has coached the Southern Brave in The Hundred. His coaching in the IPL also means that he has prior experience with youngsters and the shortest format of the game. His appointment would also make him the first coach of the Indian men\u2019s team of Sri Lankan origin.\n\n\n\nThe Future of the Indian Cricket Team\n\n\n\nWith the departures of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli (from T20s and tests), Ravichandran Ashwin, and Ravindra Jadeja (from T20s), the next India cricket team has been robbed of a lot of experience from their side. The new Indian team is a transitional side and is populated with youngsters and rising talent. In such an atmosphere the presence of a coach guiding the team becomes extremely necessary.\n\n\n\nGautam Gambhir\u2019s recent track record may be calling for a change in coaching because of them conceding a whitewash defeat to New Zealand at home and losing the Border-Gavaskar trophy for the first time in ten years. While the recently tied series in England is a positive for the Indian team, a shake-up in the coaching staff may give the boost needed to get this young Indian squad back to their winning ways.\n",

      "content_full": "\nEngland steps back into World Cup qualifying this weekend, facing Andorra at Villa Park. Thomas Tuchel\u2019s team sits atop Group K with three wins from three games, yet the mood around the side feels uneasy. A 3-1 defeat to Senegal in June exposed weaknesses, while even a narrow 1-0 win against Andorra earlier this year showed a lack of spark.\n\n\n\nTuchel\u2019s England has been described as efficient but uninspiring. The results are there\u2014three wins, no goals conceded\u2014but the performances have lacked energy. Against lesser-ranked sides like Andorra, the question is not whether England wins, but how they win. For Tuchel, this match is a chance to show that his team can combine substance with style.\n\n\n\nInjuries, Omissions, and Big Calls\n\n\n\nThe buildup has been dominated by squad changes. Injuries have stripped Tuchel of Bukayo Saka, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Cole Palmer, and Levi Colwill. Adam Wharton was also ruled out, paving the way for Ruben Loftus-Cheek to make a surprise return after seven years away from the squad.\n\n\n\nTuchel\u2019s decisions have raised eyebrows. Trent Alexander-Arnold has been left out, with the manager citing the need for him to settle in Madrid. Jack Grealish has also been excluded. Instead, Reece James and Marcus Rashford are expected to start, while debut opportunities could come for Djed Spence, Elliot Anderson, James Trafford, and Jarell Quansah.\n\n\n\nHarry Kane remains the constant. The England captain is set to win his 108th cap, equalling Bobby Moore. His presence gives Tuchel\u2019s reshaped side an anchor, but the creativity around him will depend on new and returning names.\n\n\n\nAndorra\u2019s Defensive Challenge\n\n\n\nFor Andorra, survival is the only aim. They have not scored in qualifying and are ranked 174th in the world. Their performance in June, however, offers a glimmer of hope. Goalkeeper Iker Alvarez delivered a man-of-the-match display in Barcelona, frustrating England\u2019s attack. Manager Koldo Alvarez will rely on similar resilience, hoping for a goalless draw.\n\n\n\nThe visitors are likely to defend with a deep 5-4-1 system, leaving Ricard Fern\u00e1ndez as the lone striker. It is not a strategy to win, but one to resist. England\u2019s challenge is to break down a side with no ambition beyond keeping the score respectable.\n\n\n\nVilla Park and the Weight of History\n\n\n\nThe choice of venue adds another layer. With Wembley occupied by Coldplay concerts, England returns to Villa Park. Their record there is mixed: just four wins in nine games. History might not be the determiner of this match; however, it does serve as a reminder that England has failed to perform so well outside of their traditional home.\n\n\n\nDjed Spence also has a slice of possible history, having the potential to become the first Muslim to represent England at the senior level. His debut would be some milestone in the history of the national team.\n\n\n\nWhat to Expect\n\n\n\nOn paper, this is a mismatch. England has won all seven previous meetings against Andorra, scoring 26 goals and conceding none. Their biggest win, a 6-0 in 2009, feels far from likely under Tuchel\u2019s current approach. Instead, expect control, patience, and possibly frustration if the breakthrough does not come early.\n\n\n\nThis game is less about the result and more about the manner of it. Can Tuchel\u2019s England show creativity, or will it be another efficient but forgettable display? For the manager, the pressure is not immediate qualification\u2014England are already favorites to top the group\u2014but to prove that his side can inspire as well as succeed.\n\n\n\nFinal Word\n\n\n\nEngland should win comfortably. Anything less than three points would be a shock. Yet the deeper question remains: can Tuchel turn this side into more than just functional winners? Against Andorra, the scoreboard may matter less than the statement. A convincing, stylish win could ease doubts. Another labored performance might only confirm them.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe Indian Premier League (IPL) is more than cricket; it is a cultural sensation that connects millions of people with its electric matches and crazy fan engagement. While we are counting down to IPL 2026, we are faced with a significant challenge: a GST increase to 40% on match tickets and streaming subscriptions, up from the current 28%. This increase has created uncertainty and concern about how this will affect accessibility, affordability, and the IPL brand\u2019s spirit of inclusion.\n\n\n\nAs fans, franchises, and the BCCI come to terms with the digitization of cricket responsibility as well as the reality of the GST increase, potentially changing the IPL economy and culture. It raises significant questions about the future of the IPL and the magic that it brings. This article will examine the reasons for the GST increase, impacts on fans and franchises, and potential ways to mitigate the problems to ensure we can continue to enjoy the IPL across the country.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the GST hike\n\n\n\nThe increase in GST is part of India\u2019s wider move to strengthen government revenue through tax reforms. While the policy covers several sectors, the effect on the IPL, a mass-entertainment product, is of specific attention. A ticket priced at \u20b92,000 previously included a GST charge of \u20b9560. Now at 40% it adds \u20b9800, meaning that the ticket price including GST is now \u20b92,800.\n\n\n\nStreaming subscriptions, important for IPL\u2019s digital revenues, are not excluded from the increases. It seems unlucky for the league, which is facing increased operational costs and economic pressures from many angles, to deal with such a high-profile issue. Fans and followers of the league are targeting social media platforms like X, and the hashtag #SaveIPLFans has been used to express their frustration about being priced out of their sport.\n\n\n\nImpact on fans\u2019 attendance in the stadium\n\n\n\nThe IPL\u2019s thrilling stadium atmosphere, created by its passionate crowds, is one of the reasons its global appeal is unmatched. However, an increase in GST may kill this vibe, mostly for middle-class families who purchase lower-tier tickets and take their kids to games. If the ticket prices go up, as they might, it is very likely that attendance will drop, especially in smaller venues where the opportunity to buy the lower-tier tickets is a big reason to attend.\n\n\n\nFor example, a family of 4 will spend a lot more on the tickets for a single match of IPL, which may mean they don\u2019t go as often as they used to. The issue with having fewer people in the stands is that it results in a less boisterous atmosphere overall, which takes away some of the brilliant experience for viewers at home. In addition, there are streaming subscriptions as well that will be taxed at 40%, so the fans that can\u2019t afford to go to the game now have to consider using illegal streaming sites if they want to enjoy the game online that are not at the stadium, which creates another layer of complexity to the IPL\u2019s digital ecosystem.\n\n\n\nChallenges for the franchise and economy\n\n\n\nGenerally, franchises that depend primarily on ticket sales could get hit hard due to the GST increase. Franchises in tier-2 cities with smaller capacity stadiums would potentially suffer big losses if attendance declines. Commercial sponsorships, important for IPL franchises\u2019 budgets, could also potentially be reconsidered, as brands review their purchases associated with a league potentially suffering from reduced engagement by the audience.\n\n\n\nDuring the IPL 2025 auction, an important event for team-building, franchises have to be more cautious with money spent to offset revenue issues and potentially not have a stronger roster. Ultimately, the wider cricket economy, including vendors, local shops and businesses, broadcasters, and even tourism, would experience changes too. The increase in the GST may be a test for other sports in India, with ramifications for the likelihood of low-cost access to live events.\n\n\n\nPossible solution to preserve the legacy of IPL\n\n\n\nStakeholders need to move quickly and develop plans to accommodate the GST increase. Franchises could absorb a portion of the additional tax on low-tier tickets to maintain price protections for the core fan. Loyalty programs, discounted passes, ticket and merchandise bundles, could additionally incentivise attendance. Broadcasters continue to elevate the streaming experience too by integrating member/communal features, such as live stats, fan polling, and virtual watch parties, to drive engagement.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSimultaneously, the BCCI is working with the government to lobby for relief, outlining cricket\u2019s cultural value in India. Additionally, fan-focused marketing campaigns, subsidized tickets for students, and a fan community help in retention of IPL wellness, which is possible. Collective efforts amongst the BCCI, franchises, and broadcasters will need to find a balance in distance between financial sustainability and accessibility.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBoth corporate boxes and stands at IPL matches reflect the league\u2019s brand. As ticket pricing rises, unless it rises sharply, millions will continue to consume the IPL and reflect its cultural and economic value. As IPL 2026 approaches, the BCCI and franchises need to resource creative and unique ideas to preserve the nature of the league. At the end of the day, it will be about developing and implementing fan-oriented policies, a creative and unique approach to strategy, as well as focusing on the social and cultural value of the IPL, while attempting to keep it unique.\n",

      "content_full": "\nEngland\u2019s experienced campaigner Joe Root once again proved why he is the backbone of their batting lineup, registering a composed 61 in the second ODI against South Africa at Lord\u2019s. Although England ultimately fell short, Joe Root\u2019s knock gave them much-needed stability after an early collapse and kept hopes alive during the middle stages of the innings.\n\n\n\nEarly Rescue Act\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s innings got off to the worst possible start, losing opener Jamie Smith the very first ball of the match. With the scoreboard reading 0/1, Joe Root walked in under immense pressure. He immediately shouldered responsibility, absorbing the early movement and guiding the side through the initial scare. Partnering with Ben Duckett, Joe Root stitched a crucial 66-run stand for the second wicket. \n\n\n\nWhile Duckett struggled for fluency, making just 14 off 33 balls, Root ensured England kept the scoreboard ticking with the timely boundaries and strike rotation\n\n\n\nPartnership with Jacob Bethell\n\n\n\nAfter Ben Duckett\u2019s dismissal, Joe Root found solid support in young Jacob Bethell, who played an attacking hand. Together the pair added 77 runs, shifting momentum in England\u2019s favor. Bethell\u2019s positive stroke play allowed Joe Root to play the anchor role, a familiar task he has mastered over the years.\n\n\n\nRoot looked assured against both pace and spin, placing the ball into the gaps and punishing loose deliveries. The partnership hinted at a potential recovery for England, but South Africa struck back at the right time. Bethell departed for 58, and Root followed shortly after, Stumped off Keshav Maharaj in the 25th over with England\u2019s score at 147/4.\n\n\n\nMilestone Moment\n\n\n\nJoe Root\u2019s 61 off 72 balls, featuring eight crisp boundaries, was his 43rd ODI half-century. It was also his sixth fifty-plus score against South Africa in the format, underlining his consistency against one of the strongest bowling units. With this knock he equaled Alex Hales for the joint most 50-plus scores by an Englishman against South Africa in ODIs. Joe Root now has 765 runs from 20 matches against the Proteas at an average of 44.16, including two centuries.\n\n\n\nLord\u2019s Specialist\n\n\n\nThe innings also added another feather to Root\u2019s already impressive record in home conditions. This was his 21st half-century on England soil, taking his tally to 3,681 home ODI runs at an average of 48.43. At the iconic Lord\u2019s, he has now amassed 466 runs in 11 matches, including three fifties and a century. His ability to rise to the occasion at the Home of Cricket once again shone through.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s Reliance on Root\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough his dismissal halted England\u2019s momentum, Root\u2019s calmness and experience highlighted his importance in the middle order. With youngsters like Bethell still learning, Root\u2019s presence provides balance in pressure situations. His innings, though, gave England belief it must win the contest, even though South Africa sealed the series with a clinical display. For England, Root\u2019s steadinessremains a vital silver lining as they look to regroup and rebuild their one-day dominance.\n\n\n\nWhere England Went Wrong\n\n\n\n\nTop -order collapse \u2013 Openers failed to provide a solid start, putting pressure on the middle order\n\n\n\nLack of Partnerships \u2013 No batter stayed long enough to support Root, leaving him knocked isolated.\n\n\n\nstruggles Against Spin \u2013 Most batters hesitated at the crease and gifted wickets cheaply \n\n\n\nIneffective Bowling \u2013 Bowlers missed their lengths, allowed easy runs and couldn\u2019t create breakthroughs.\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe way supporters buy tickets for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be unlike any previous tournament. For the first time, FIFA is introducing a dynamic pricing model for all ticket sales. The competition, which will be staged across the United States, Mexico, and Canada, is already historic in size and scale. Now, even the ticketing system is about to make history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic pricing isn\u2019t new to North American fans. The system is widely used in the NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball, and even for concerts. Prices move up and down depending on demand, sometimes changing within hours. What\u2019s new is FIFA adopting it for the world\u2019s biggest sporting event, and that has triggered excitement and concern in equal measure.\n\n\n\nWhy FIFA Is Doing It\n\n\n\nAt its core, dynamic pricing is simple. If demand soars, prices rise. If a match proves less attractive, prices may soften. Unlike a fixed-price model, this system constantly responds to the market. FIFA has argued that it reflects the reality of hosting in North America, where fans are already used to this approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe governing body tested the system during the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. There, some tickets initially sold for high prices but later plunged, with semi-final seats falling to just over $13 before kickoff due to sluggish sales. FIFA says that won\u2019t happen in 2026, promising that no ticket will drop below its original face value.\n\n\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\n\n\nWhat the Prices Look Like\n\n\n\nFor fans, the numbers are stark. Entry-level tickets for group matches will start at $60. At the other end of the scale, a seat at the final could cost as much as $6,730. \n\n\n\n\nSingle-game ticket prices for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will range from as low as $60 for group stage matches to $6,710 for a spot at the World Cup final \ud83d\udcb0Those prices might, and likely will, change somewhat over the coming months. pic.twitter.com/SMDftHRmnf\u2014 ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) September 3, 2025\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a steep climb from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where ticket prices generally ranged between $69 and $1,600. FIFA has justified the hike by pointing to the expanded format of 2026, 48 nations, 104 matches, and more venues than ever before. The organization also argues that the North American sports market plays by different rules: fans are used to paying premium prices for marquee events, and the demand for seats is expected to be overwhelming.\n\n\n\nSource: Reuters\n\n\n\nThe Sales Process\n\n\n\nGetting tickets won\u2019t be as simple as logging on and buying one. The process has been broken into several phases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first chance comes with the Visa presale draw, scheduled from September 10 to 19, 2025. Around one million tickets will be available, but only Visa cardholders can enter. Winners will be given purchasing slots in October, with limits of four tickets per match and ten matches total.\n\n\n\n\nThe @Visa Presale Draw will start first phase of #FIFAWorldCup26 ticket sales \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0fFind out more and how to enter:\u2014 FIFA (@FIFAcom) July 31, 2025\n\n\n\n\nLater in October, another lottery will open to the general public. The real scramble, though, will begin after the official draw on December 5, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Once fixtures are revealed, fans will know exactly which matches they\u2019re applying for. Tickets will again be allocated by lottery. Any leftovers will eventually move to a general sale closer to the tournament \n\n\n\nSource: Axios\n\n\n\nResale and Scalping\n\n\n\nFIFA will also operate its own resale platform. Unlike previous editions, there will be no price cap on resold tickets. FIFA claims this will undercut black-market scalpers by bringing everything into an official system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Mexico, the resale platform will be monitored in partnership with PROFECO, the country\u2019s consumer protection agency. Even so, many fans and consumer groups worry this will simply drive prices higher, particularly for knockout matches.\n\n\n\nSource: FourFourTwo\n\n\n\nNew Categories for Seats\n\n\n\nAlong with pricing, FIFA is reshaping how seats are categorized. Instead of the old model that priced tickets based on sidelines, corners, or behind-the-goal views, the 2026 system is more straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing a new ticketing structure: seat categories now align with stadium levels.\n\n\n\n\nCat 1 \u2013 Lower tiers (premium).\n\n\n\n\n\nCat 2 \u2013 Suite & mid-level seats.\n\n\n\n\n\nCat 3 & 4 \u2013 Upper tiers (Cat 4 is the most affordable).\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessible seating is available in all venues.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking ticket selection simpler for fans across North America.\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\n\n\nThe Debate Around It\n\n\n\nThe changes have divided opinion. Supporters argue that it modernizes the World Cup, makes the ticketing process more flexible, and ensures stadiums are full. FIFA also stresses that revenues from ticket sales will be shared with all 211 member associations, not just the hosts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut critics see a different picture. Many believe the policy prioritizes money over fans, pointing to soaring top-end prices and the lack of caps in the resale market. In a column for The Guardian, the approach was described bluntly as \u201cprofit at all costs.\u201d\n\n\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\n\n\nWhat Fans Should Expect\n\n\n\nFor anyone planning to attend, timing will be crucial. The best chance at affordable tickets will come during the early draws. Waiting until later, especially for marquee games like semi-finals or the final, could mean paying far more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup is already set to be historic. It\u2019s the first edition hosted in three countries and the first to feature 48 teams. With dynamic pricing, it will also be remembered for changing how the world\u2019s biggest sporting event sells access to fans. For some, it may open up new opportunities to attend matches. For others, it may put the dream of being there just out of reach.\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nRoss Taylor\u2019s shocking comeback to lead Samoa to T20 qualifiers\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates, and\u00a0stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nRoss Taylor, a legendary former New Zealand batsman, has come out of retirement to represent Samoa for the T20 World Cup 2026 qualifiers. Taylor, who has played 112 Tests, 234 ODIs, and 102 T20Is for New Zealand (and has scored over 18,000 international runs), will be making his international comeback in a Samoan shirt. \n\n\n\nHe will be the 7th cricketer to represent two nations after Sammy Guillen, Luke Ronchi, Michael Rippon, Corey Anderson, Mark Chapman, and Tom Bruce.\n\n\n\nTaylor\u2019s decision to represent Samoa is not just a personal achievement but a potential vehicle for change in associate cricket. The intent behind this phenomenal comeback, the visible expression of heritage and ambition, and being a flagbearer for the next generation might change the future of cricket in Samoa and inspire Pacific cricketers.\n\n\n\nFrom Blackcaps to Samoa\n\n\n\nTaylor has a true connection to Samoa. His mother, Ann, is Samoan, and he has long expressed a great sense of pride in his heritage. After retiring from international cricket in 2022, Taylor continued playing in various domestic leagues and took on coaching roles, but many were surprised that he would return to competitive cricket in such a bold way. \n\n\n\nSamoa, an East Asia-Pacific associate nation, allows Taylor to give back to the game while chasing a dream of leading Samoa into the T20 World Cup 2026, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\nTaylor has used his skill as a middle-order batter to be calm and responsible at the crease, scoring over 18,000 international runs for New Zealand. With much less exposure to high-level cricket, Taylor could have a transformative impact for Samoa. The T20 format requires quick thinking and adaptation, which matches well with Taylor\u2019s profile as a cricketer. \n\n\n\nTaylor will be a huge help in reading games, supporting the younger players, and key situations under pressure throughout their qualifiers in early 2026. Samoa will certainly have strong competition from the other associate nations, but Taylor, on the side, might swing the games in their favor.\n\n\n\nChallenges of age, fitness, and team cohesion\n\n\n\n\u00a0The road ahead would undoubtedly be rigorous. At 41 years of age, the peak level of physical fitness necessary to play T20 cricket cannot be underestimated. The nature of T20 cricket requires several key attributes; agility, speed, and endurance are essential, and age can sometimes be seen as an impediment to these attributes. \n\n\n\nA high-profile player addition to a relatively inexperienced squad poses a greater risk. Team culture will be paramount, especially since the players from Samoa, many of whom play for leisure while working professionally elsewhere, will look to Taylor for both serious and fun leadership. Building a merged team culture in a very short time will be a test of Taylor\u2019s leadership in both social and cricket terms.\n\n\n\nThe preparation will actually be difficult in itself. With so few chances for kindred nations to qualify for the T20 World Cup, the stakes will be high. A number of teams have made good progress in the past few years, including Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, so Taylor will need to foster good performances. His job is not just to perform with the bat but also to foster young Samoans and build a winning mentality that will last long after any actual qualification.\n\n\n\nBeyond qualification: A legacy for Associate Cricket\n\n\n\nTaylor\u2019s comeback is not only about him but also a statement about associate cricket. His appearance marks a recognition of the potential for Pacific nations, typically underappreciated by cricketing nations. A successful campaign might attract investment, develop infrastructure, and foster a love of cricket among young Samoans. \n\n\n\nThe support for Taylor has been marked online, especially on X, with fans going so far as to call it a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d The importance of Taylor is being demonstrated with highlights of his T20I century against Sri Lanka in 2010, which serve as a reminder that he is still class.\n\n\n\nThe potential implications are considerable. If Ross can steer Samoa through the World Cup, it would be a landmark achievement for associate nations, proving that effort and star power could compress the gap between minnows and giants. Even should the run end, his devotion to Samoa might allow other emergent stars to pursue the pathway in the region. For now, Ross is focused on the moment and training with a group of players eager to be coached by a legend.\n\n\n\nWith the qualifiers on the horizon, all eyes will be on Taylor. Can he overcome age, unite a team, and bring Samoa to its first cricketing glory? The narrative already inspires, intertwining heritage, ambition, and love for the game. Be it as the anchor of an innings or a mentor for a teammate, Ross Taylor\u2019s return will undoubtedly remind us that the game of cricket works best in its most unexpected places.\n",

Pollard of the Trinbago Knight Riders against the Royals of Barbados at Brian Lara Stadium, Tarouba, reached the mark in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) 2025 game with a 19 not out using 9 balls (a six).\n\n\n\nThe game in which Kieron Pollard broke the record:\n\n\n\nAs the Trinbago Knight Riders attempted to chase down 179, Pollard literally dedicated himself when proven hitters Nicholas Pooran and Colin Munro blasted incredible fifties that changed the entire game. Pollard certainly made his mark in the history of the sport and the pursuit when he appeared, having struck 19 off nine balls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKieron Pollard is the second player to achieve this, and he is now only the second to make it, following Chris Gayle, who had 14,562 T20 runs in 463 games.\n\n\n\nPollard played 712 Twenty20 games to get there, which only goes to demonstrate how long he has been playing.\n\n\n\n\nHis Other Records:\n\n\n\n\nKieron Pollard\u2019s career record, which includes a century and an incredible sixty-four half-centuries, demonstrates his capacity to score large and reliably.\n\n\n\nWith more than 330 T20 wickets under his belt, Pollard is a true all-rounder player in the game.\n\n\n\nKieron Pollard is one of the most deadly batters in T20 history with 876 fours and 942 sixes.\n\n\n\n\nKieron Pollard T20 Batting Stats:\n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsRunsAverageStrike RateHighest Score100s50sODI10183156925.3135.17506\n\n\n\nA T20 Veteran: Pollard\u2019s Adaptability Across Conditions:\n\n\n\nIt is not only about how he scores his runs that made Pollard a successful man but also his ability to adjust and adapt to different leagues through the years. Kieron Pollard has represented about 20 clubs across the world, including the Mumbai Indians in the IPL and the CPL, BBL, SA20, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, he has done well and is a huge name in the IPL, even having won a few titles with the Mumbai Indians. All this adds up to a 20-year-long career.\n\n\n\nPollard\u2019s Unique Legacy:\n\n\n\nKieron Pollard is 38, but he\u2019s still the complete T20 player: he hits big in the middle, bowls decent medium pace, is a gun in the field, and is a leader people respect. His having of over 14,000 runs and 300 wickets. That just goes to prove the goodness of him and how long he has been doing it.\n\n\n\nAll the cricket enthusiasts will not forget him due to the sixes that he made against Asian giant Sri Lanka, his IPL wins and how he tutored young players. And now that all this is in the past, he has definitely won the crown of being one of the best T20 players in the game.\n\n\n\nPollard as a Mentor and Leader:\n\n\n\nPollard is also someone younger cricket players could now admire, besides being great himself. During his time with the Mumbai Indians, the West Indies, and most recently the CPL, he has assisted in the training of such talents as Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell, and Shimron Hetmyer. He has been referred to as one of the best leaders in cricket, as he is good at tactics, remains calm at the right time, and can come to the aid of young players when things get rough. Since Pollard is a great mentor and a great gamer, his influence will last long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Pollard?\n\n\n\nNaturally, concerns regarding Pollard\u2019s future surface at the age of 38. Even though he may no longer play for the West Indies internationally, he still rules franchise cricket. The 2025 CPL is evidence that his hitting ability has not decreased with age.\n\n\n\nGiven his tactical prowess, many think he may go into a full-time coaching or mentoring position. So long as he can push the limits and add to his legendary tally without any difficulty, fans are happy to see it.\n\n\n\nKieron Pollard joining the 14,000-run T20 is not just a congratulation to himself but to T20 in general. Pollard has been the living embodiment of the shortest game: talent, entertainment and unpredictability through his amazing sixes and his performances that make the game.\n\n\n\nIt is important that Pollard has been able to do this and has become next to Chris Gayle, as that means that even in the T20 era, West Indian cricket remains influential. There is one thing that is definite as the CPL continues: Pollard is not done talking with his bat.\n",

On paper, routine. But if you were inside the Monumental, the score almost vanished into the background. It wasn\u2019t really about the goals or even the result. The whole night revolved around the man in the No. 10 shirt Lionel Messi and the suffocating sense that this could be his last dance on home soil. \n\n\n\nYou felt it before a ball was kicked. The noise had a different edge, almost desperate. People weren\u2019t just watching; they were clinging to the moment.

He didn\u2019t call it retirement, not yet. But his words carried that quiet honesty, the kind that makes you stop and realize even legends can\u2019t outrun time forever. For the fans, that was enough to plant the fear: maybe this really is the beginning of the end. And that\u2019s why this night didn\u2019t feel like a simple match report you scroll past the next morning.

Maybe he plays again, maybe he doesn\u2019t but nobody inside the Monumental will ever forget the way it felt. This wasn\u2019t just a goodbye; it was Messi choosing the way to step off: with the ball at his feet, with a stadium roaring his name, and with an entire country holding on to him like they never wanted to let go.\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa Eye for Series Win at Lord\u2019s against England\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates, and\u00a0stay tuned!\n",

      "content_full": "\nEngland will face South Africa in the second ODI of the three-match series at Lord\u2019s, London, on Thursday, September 4, 2025. The visitors are already 1-0 ahead after a dominant seven-wicket victory at Headingley. The question now is: will England fight back to level the series, or will South Africa seal it with one match to spare?\n\n\n\nEngland vs South Africa Match Preview\n\n\n\nIn the first ODI at Headingley, South Africa decimated England, who were outclassed and cleaned up for just 131 runs, leading to a seven-wicket victory for South Africa. England\u2019s bowling woes were exposed as debutant Sonny Baker was taken to the cleaners by Aiden Markram. With South Africa heading into this contest eyeing a series win, Harry Brook will face his first real test as captain, and it will be interesting to see how he responds.\n\n\n\nHead-to-Head Record in ODIs:\n\n\n\nEngland and South Africa have met 72 times in ODIs. England has won 30 matches, and South Africa 36, with five no results and one tie. Their rivalry began in 1992 and in the most recent clash on September 2, 2025, South Africa won by seven wickets.\n\n\n\nEngland Preview\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s ODI struggles continued at Headingley, where they were bowled out for just 131. After a strong start led by Jamie Smith\u2019s quick 54, which had them in a solid position at 82-2, England suffered a dramatic collapse, losing their last eight wickets for only 49 runs.\n\n\n\nDuring the chase, England\u2019s bowling was ineffective, particularly from debutant Sonny Baker, who was hit all over the ground, finishing with expensive figures of 0-76 from seven overs. Although Adil Rashid managed to take three wickets late in the game, it was too little, too late, as the match was already out of reach.\n\n\n\nSince the 2023 World Cup, their journey has been full of setbacks. First, they lost 1-2 in the Caribbean, and then they slipped 2-3 at home to Australia. Soon after, they fell 1-2 again in the West Indies, followed by a painful 0-3 whitewash in India and a Champions Trophy exit. The only bright spot was a 3-0 home sweep of the West Indies earlier this year. Now at the Home of Cricket, England must rediscover that spark or risk another series slipping away.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa Preview\n\n\n\nSouth Africa has not had much success at Lord\u2019s, having won only one of the five ODI matches played at the venue, and that win came while chasing. Therefore, South Africa will once again look to bowl first in this fixture and follow the same blueprint as they did in the last match.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa vs. England\u2014Probable Playing XI\n\n\n\nEngland Probable Playing XI:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Jamie Smith, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Jacob Bethell, Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Sonny Baker\n\n\n\nSouth Africa Probable Playing XI\n\n\n\nAiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Tony de Zorzi, Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis, Wiaan Mulder, Corbin Bosch, Keshav Maharaj, Nandre Burger, Lungi Ngidi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLord\u2019s Pitch Report\n\n\n\nThe Pitch of the Lord, whose slope so well known doth give swing early, wakes the skill of batters. Bounce and pace can be trusted as the game advances to make the strokes. On dry surfaces spinners are likely to get assistance. Thus, it is usually prudent to bat first but bowlers tend to rule the initial rounds.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, England also smashed Australia by 186 runs in the final ODI in this series and scored 312 runs and then bowled them out of 126. That game brought out the early seam and swing characteristic of Lord to punish batters but once established, stroke makers can take over on this special slope.\n\n\n\n\n",

Having secured qualification to the World Cup, the big challenge now is to mould a team that can finally lift the trophy after 24 years. Brazil will have another opportunity to refreeze that identity against Chile \u2013 and they will do so again without their most popular number 10.\n\n\n\nA New Identity Under Ancelotti\n\n\n\nWhen Ancelotti took charge in June, he promised that his Brazil would play like Real Madrid \u201clast year.\u201d By that, he meant a disciplined, balanced side that relies on shape, midfield control, and quick transitions. In his first two games, a 0-0 draw with Ecuador and a 1-0 win over Paraguay, we already saw hints of that.\n\n\n\n\u26bd\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 Carlo Ancelotti le mete miedo a la Roja con la formaci\u00f3n de Brasil y le env\u00eda un duro recado a Neymar https://t.co/dVRPmGiauq pic.twitter.com/uOPZDkNXIt\u2014 El Deportivo LT (@ElDeportivoLT) September 4, 2025 \n\n\n\nThe chaotic 4-2-4 shape Brazil used in recent years is gone. Instead, Ancelotti has leaned on a structured midfield. Casemiro and Bruno Guimar\u00e3es remain central, while additions like \u00c9derson and Andreas Pereira show his preference for a three-man engine room over winger overloads. It may not yet look like Madrid at their best, but the foundations are visible.\n\n\n\nNeymar Left Out Again\n\n\n\nThe biggest talking point is Neymar\u2019s absence. Ancelotti has now left him out for three straight windows. Officially, the coach says it is a tactical decision, not about fitness. He insists Brazil must pick the 26 players most ready to serve the team.\n\n\n\nNeymar sees it differently. After playing 90 minutes for Santos last weekend, he made it clear he feels fit. \u201cThis is technical, not physical,\u201d he said, adding that he respects the coach\u2019s choice but does not agree. The forward has not featured for Brazil since his ACL tear against Uruguay in October 2023, and with only six goals in 19 games for Santos since then, doubts about his long-term role are growing.\n\n\n\nYoung Talent Given the Stage\n\n\n\nWhile Neymar watches from home, Ancelotti is giving opportunities to younger players. Endrick, just 19, and Savinho, 21, are expected to stretch Chile\u2019s aging full-backs. Both have the pace and energy to thrive in the system. Richarlison, back in form with Tottenham, leads the line, while Chelsea\u2019s Joao Pedro and Estevao Willian bring new depth in attack.\n\n\n\nThis balance of veterans and emerging stars is exactly what Ancelotti wants. With Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Rodrygo rested, it is a chance for fringe players to prove they belong in the World Cup squad.\n\n\n\nChile Test Comes at the Right Time\n\n\n\nChile sit bottom of CONMEBOL qualifying, which makes this a perfect match to experiment. Brazil need goals after scoring just once in Ancelotti\u2019s first two games. The midfield trio will be tested on their ability to control tempo and release quick counters. Full-backs Danilo and Renan Lodi also carry responsibility to provide width, much like Madrid\u2019s system.\n\n\n\nThe Road to 2026\n\n\n\nThe last time Brazil won the world cup was in 2002. Ancelotti has made it very clear that it is high time to bring an end to that drought. There are fewer than 12 months to go, so each choice now is about getting the right 26 players into the tournament.\n\n\n\nThe decision to leave Neymar out is a very bold one, however, it is an indication that reputations will not be the only factor that will determine the future of Brazil. \n\n\n\nAncelotti is building a team that is in his own style, pragmatic, possession-savvy, and tactically disciplined. With Chile we might have a glimpse of how far this project has gone, and how much remains to be done.\n\n\n\nMore Stories :\n\n\n\n\nJames Milner\u2019s Emotional Tribute to Diogo Jota in Brighton\u2019s Win Over Manchester City\n\n\n\nLAFC vs San Diego FC: Preview, How to Watch Kickoff Time, and Key Storylines\n\n\n\nTottenham Refuse to Give Up on Manchester City Winger Savinho\n\n\n\nDurand Cup 2025 Final: Northeast United FC defend title with emphatic 6\u20131 victory\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nIndia is set to host the next iteration of the T20 World Cup in 2026. India will assume the responsibility of being both the defending champions and the host nation for the next World Cup, which inarguably makes them one of the hot favorites to win the World Cup. The recent announcement of India\u2019s side for the Asia Cup gives us a sneak peek into their strategy for the coming World Cup in home conditions.\n\n\n\nThe game of T20 cricket is a constantly evolving beast, being influenced by trends across both international cricket and franchise cricket around the world. This has evolved the game in a way that T20 cricket has emboldened players to hit more boundaries through their innings, not putting a large price on their wicket and transitioning from playing anchor innings to more of a role player in the team.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s squad for the Asia Cup: Surya Kumar Yadav (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Sanju Samson (WK), Harshit Rana, and Rinku Singh.\n\n\n\nThe start of the post-Virat-Rohit era\n\n\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be the first ICC tournament that India will play without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the squad. These two have been stalwarts of the Indian white-ball side, and without them, we are already seeing how the Indian side has evolved as a T20 side. India used to be notoriously slow in the power play over until the T20 World Cup in 2022, after which the team helmed by Rohit Sharma started to make a change in their outlook towards T20 cricket.\n\n\n\nInfluenced by the IPL and Rohit Sharma at the top, India also integrated themselves into a team consisting of role players and prioritized boundary hitting, which ultimately brought returns for them when they won the 2024 T20 World Cup and secured an ICC title after 11 years. While Rohit transformed himself into a boundary-hitting behemoth in the opening position, Kohli remained an anchor-type batter through the middle of the innings and accelerated towards the end.\n\n\n\nThe current Indian side has batting upto number 8 with lower-order finishers and all-rounders who extend their batting lineup in the likes of Axar Patel, Rinku Singh, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube and Jitesh Sharma, who can employ death overs boundary hitting to boost the score in the death overs. The depth in batting helps the top and middle order to play freely at their own place and take the bowlers on during the powerplay and the middle overs.\n\n\n\nThe top order and the middle order, consisting of the likes of Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shubman Gill, Sanju Samson, and Tilak Yadav, are freer to hit more boundaries and put less of a price on their wicket. The longer batting order also gives the top-order players more freedom not to slow down in the middle overs of the T20 innings and keep hitting boundaries and keeping the run rate around 10 an over even in the case of a collapse.\n\n\n\nThe bowling department\n\n\n\nVarun Chakravarty is the newest mystery spinner in the Indian team.\n\n\n\nIndia suffers from no lack in their strike bowling department with the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakravarty and Kuldeep Yadav in their ranks. With the UAE hosting the Asia Cup and the T20 World Cup being hosted in combination by India and Sri Lanka, India can expect spin-friendly tracks that are slow and gripping, leaving enough room for Kuldeep and Chakravarty to shine.\n\n\n\nIndia only suffers in one aspect: they do not have bowlers who can hit sixes in the death. While other teams have bowlers such as Cummins or Jofra Archer, India\u2019s bowlers do not have as much boundary-hitting capacity as would be optimal for T20 sides. They also have a no. 8 problem, which they hope Harshit Rana can cover, who can both score important runs at the death and bowl his full quota of overs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe future of the Indian Team\n\n\n\nThe Indian team has also lost out on the talent of Ravi Jadeja, with his exceptionally tight bowling, death-overs hitting and mercurial fielding. Axar Patel will be looking to now fill that gap more completely, with other spinning all-rounders waiting in the rafters, such as Krunal Pandya or Vipraj Nigam.\n\n\n\nThe Asia Cup is going to be the litmus test for how this team fares, with a lot of talent sitting on the bench, such as Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag or Nitish Kumar Reddy. The likes of batters such as KL Rahul or Ruturaj Gaikwad are also waiting to break into the side. Fresh talent such as Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh or even players wanting to get back in the team, such as Ravi Bishnoi or Yuzi Chahal, are always looking for any opportunities to break down the door when it comes to the national side.\n\n\n\nThe results of the Asia Cup will help India settle on a national side that they can reliably take to the T20 World Cup and what changes they need to make to their squad composition or their playstyle to successfully defend the World Cup at home.\n",

But few of them make it into the national team. The question is, why do certain prolific domestic players always live in the shadows?\n\n\n\nCase Studies: Stars Who Never Got Their Spotlight\n\n\n\nAmol Muzumdar\u2014with over 11,000 first-class runs, he was Mumbai cricket\u2019s giant. But in an era dominated by Sachin, Dravid, and Laxman, his chance never arrived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRajinder Goel\u2014India\u2019s highest wicket-taker in Ranji history (640 wickets). Despite his dominance, he never wore the India cap, stuck behind Bishan Singh Bedi in the pecking order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWasim Jaffer\u2014the most successful domestic batsman ever, often reduced to a \u201csocial media cult hero\u201d today rather than remembered as a Test stalwart.\n\n\n\nWhy Do They Get Overlooked?\n\n\n\n\nEra of Greats: Sometimes talent collides with timing; opportunities shrink when legends are still active.\n\n\n\nSelection Bias: Criticism persists that zones and state boards wield influence. Some argue South Zone or smaller state players often get fewer chances.\n\n\n\nFormat Shift: With India prioritizing T20s, red-ball stalwarts have less value in selectors\u2019 eyes.\n\n\n\n\nVoices From the Game\n\n\n\nFormer selector Kris Srikkanth once admitted:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn India, being talented isn\u2019t always enough. Timing, politics, and perception matter as much.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, domestic veterans have repeatedly voiced frustration that the system glorifies IPL success over grinding first-class excellence.\n\n\n\nFans Know the Truth\n\n\n\nOn cricket forums, fans often debate:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWould India have been stronger if legends like Muzumdar got a chance?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDoes IPL overshadow the hard yards of Ranji cricket?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we losing Test specialists because selectors prefer instant stars?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFinal Over\n\n\n\nThe forgotten legends remind us of cricket\u2019s cruel paradox: performance doesn\u2019t always guarantee opportunity. While India celebrates its global stars, the game owes a silent debt to domestic warriors who kept the system alive. Their stories prove that sometimes, the scoreboard isn\u2019t the only measure of greatness.\n",

      "content_full": "\nOn 2 September 2025, Australian cricket supporters awoke to a post on the Australian Cricketers Association X feed stating that, potentially, one of Australia\u2019s fiercest fast bowlers, Mitchell Starc, had just announced his retirement from T20 International cricket effective immediately. \n\n\n\nStarc, who was 35 years old at the time, was looking to focus his efforts on playing Test cricket and preparing for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Starc\u2019s announcement was a somewhat surprising choice, but it was also seen as long overdue. He is a long-term devotee to red-ball cricket and looking to build on his incredible legacy as one of Australia\u2019s best all-format bowlers.\n\n\n\nStellar T20I Career\n\n\n\nMitchell Starc\u2018s T20I career was equally brilliant as his Test and ODI careers, but it has not received that level of coverage. Starc made his T20I debut in 2012 against Pakistan in Dubai and played a total of 65 T20 Internationals, taking 81 wickets at an average of 22.96, with an economy of 7.64. \n\n\n\nHe delighted fans with his ability to swing the brand-new ball, pitching close to 145kph, capable of bowling pinpoint yorkers. His best performance was playing with Australia when it won the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE. He took 10 wickets in the tournament, including 2/38 against South Africa in the Super 12 stage, which helped Australia to win the World Cup.\n\n\n\nOne of Starc\u2019s most memorable moments in T20Is was defending 11 runs in the last over against the West Indies\u2019 Andre Russell in 2019. It required skill and composure, and ultimately made for a thrilling win for Australia. Starc\u2019s best T20I figures came against Sri Lanka in 2016, when he took 4/20, ripping through the order with devastating pace and late swing. \n\n\n\nStarc finished his T20I career as Australia\u2019s leading wicket-taker in T20Is among fast bowlers (at the time of his retirement) despite limited appearances (averaging six matches per year). Chief selector George Bailey said of Starc, \u201cMitch was crucial to our 2021 World Cup win and had a unique ability to blow games open with his wickets\u201d.\n\n\n\nStarc\u2019s T20I career wasn\u2019t without ups and downs. He took to the field for the final time as a T20I bowler against India at the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean. He had a rough day at the office and went for 45 runs in four overs. That was a reminder of how this format of cricket can throw up surprises. \n\n\n\nNevertheless, Starc\u2019s overall T20I bowling record of 81 wickets in 65 matches, with 15 of those being two or more in a match, shows he was still a very potent weapon. His left-arm angle was a major factor that troubled the best batters, as well as his ability to bowl clutch death overs, in a format where spinners and medium pacers called the day.\n\n\n\nWhy retire now?\n\n\n\nStarc\u2019s decision stems from a hectic time for Australia and his clear focus on Test cricket. Starting in mid-2026, Australia will have one of the busiest Test schedules ever. A home series against Bangladesh, an away tour of SA, a four-match series against the Kiwis, and a test tour of India in January 2027. \n\n\n\nThis is not the end, then followed by a one-off 150th-anniversary Test against England and then an away Ashes series later that year. Starc will also have the 2027 ODI World Cup looming at the end of this schedule as a final frontier. He would love to win and join the elite group of Australians, Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, and Glenn McGrath, who have won three ODI World Cups.\n\n\n\nSome critics, however, argue that the retirement is rushed. Starc\u2019s depth of experience could have been useful during the 2026 T20 World Cup. Australia\u2019s pace attack is already stretched with Pat Cummins injured with lumbar stress, and Nathan Ellis away on paternity leave.\n\n\n\nA Sportskeeda analysis reported, \u201cStarc has played an average of six T20Is per year,\u201d and has continued to participate in various domestic T20 leagues with more focus on his Test and ODI format, including the IPL, where he has made over A$6.5million in the last two seasons. \n\n\n\nThis leads to questioning the workload management justification for Starc\u2019s retirement. Starc is not alone in focusing on Test and ODIs, as the seniors of Australia\u2019s squad, David Warner, retire from all formats, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Marcus Stoinis, have all retired from ODIs.\n\n\n\nThe bravery of prioritizing the slow-burning (Test) in the era of rush(T20)\n\n\n\nIn a time where T20 cricket is taking over the game around the world, Mitchell Starc\u2019s loyalty to Test cricket is both comforting and continued bravery. While many countries see franchise leagues such as the IPL, BBL, SA20, and The Hundred take over, transforming cricket into an entertainment product, here is Starc willing to swim against the tide of T20.\n\n\n\nThe rise of T20 has led to an over-tired calendar with cricketers juggling leagues and international cricket, resulting in player burnout and less focus on the longer formats. With this in mind, Starc\u2019s choice to stand down from T20Is, even though he had a successful record in it, was an unusual showing of dedication to the red-ball game. \n\n\n\nTest cricket is the pinnacle, played over five days with skill, endurance, strategy, and patience. Starc\u2019s pace, ability to swing the ball both ways, and ultimately, knack to deliver in times of need have made him a force in the format, with 400 Test wickets to illustrate it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nBy selecting Tests over T20, Starc is an inspiration who pays homage to the game. He gives assurance that preservation of traditions is being upheld, and test cricket will have a future for those purists who worry about its future. \n\n\n\nStarc certainly is a role model for other players to follow, as he doesn\u2019t believe that T20 is the pinnacle of the future and future generations will know test cricket will exist in traditional forms.\n",

No less than two remarkable performances would be the highlights of the match. All-rounder from Delhi, Ayush Badoni, and a pacer from Jammu & Kashmir, Auqib Nabi, pushed North Zone forward to the semifinals on August 31, 2025.\n\n\n\nThis piece will detail Badoni\u2019s excellent double century and Nabi\u2019s remarkable bowling and explain how both scored an impressive part of a complete team performance that caught the eye of both fans and analysts.\n\n\n\nAyush Badoni\u2019s Fluent Double Ton: A Red-Ball Masterclass\n\n\n\nAyush Badoni, a 25-year-old batter from Delhi, created history in the Duleep Trophy by scoring an unbeaten 204 off 223 balls and became only the second player to score a double century in first-class cricket. Resuming at 388/2 on Day 4, the North Zone decided to bat on and declared for an incredible 658/4, for a total lead of 833 runs and a drawn match.\n\n\n\nBadoni resumed his innings on 56 and continued to bat with authority, reaching his century in 123 balls and his double century in 222 balls, finishing off with a boundary in the last hour. In the last hour of play, Badoni scored 54 runs from 55 balls and struck 13 fours and 3 sixes, a mix of aggressive and precise strokes.\n\n\n\nBadoni\u2019s 204* is his second-highest first-class score, behind a 205* off 216 for Delhi vs Jharkhand in the 2024 Ranji Trophy. Earlier in the Duleep Trophy, Badoni batted conservatively yet aggressively to dominate East Zone bowlers Shami and Manishi, especially during the second innings. He achieved a strike rate of 91.47. In partnership with Ankit Kumar (198) and Yash Dhull (133), they brought the North Zone into a massive lead and set themselves up for victory. In only 15 first-class matches, Badoni has now scored over 1,200 runs at an average of over 55, including four hundreds and four fifties.\n\n\n\nAuqib Nabi\u2019s Historic Bowling: A Double Hat-Trick\n\n\n\nIf Badoni\u2019s bat sparkled, Auqib Nabi\u2018s bowling magic on Day 2 flipped the match firmly on its head. The 28-year-old Jammu & Kashmir quick bowler unleashed a scintillating spell of bowling to collect 5/28, which included a rare double hat-trick (four wickets in four consecutive balls) in the first innings of the East Zone. East Zone was chasing the North Zone total of 405, bowled out for 230 in 56.1 overs, conceding a first innings lead of 175 runs to North.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNabi\u2019s spell commenced with the dismissal of Virat Singh (69) and finished in the 53rd over when he dismissed four East Zone players in the one over. Nabi dismissed Suraj Jaiswal, Manishi, Mukhtar Hussain, and finally Mohammed Shami (lbw).\n\n\n\nNabi\u2019s accomplishment put him in history as just the third bowler in Duleep Trophy history to take a hat-trick, along with legends Kapil Dev and Sairaj Bahutule, and the first to take four wickets in four balls. His accuracy and speed, at an average of about 130 km/h, caught the attention of teammate Arshdeep Singh, who claimed Nabi took \u201cseven wickets in ten balls\u201d during nets.\n\n\n\nNabi\u2019s 44 runs in North Zone\u2019s first innings contributed to his all-around performance, and he was awarded the Player of the Match. Since this impressive performance, which came off the back of an astounding 44 wickets in a Ranji Trophy season, there have been increases in calls for a Test cap for India, with fans dubbing him a \u201cgenerational talent.\u201d\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nAyush Badoni\u2019s 204* and Nabi\u2019s remarkable 5/28 with a rare double hat-trick led North Zone to the easy victory in the quarter-finals, and then they went on to meet South Zone in the semi-final on September 4. Badoni\u2019s classy double-hundred was the cornerstone of North\u2019s mammoth innings of 833 runs. Nabi\u2019s fiery spell was all the more exciting to witness because he recorded four wickets on four consecutive deliveries. He will likely be considered one of India\u2019s new generation of fast bowlers.\n\n\n\nThe event is a testament to the enduring usefulness of the Duleep Trophy, continuing to be a launching pad for India\u2019s next stars and a stage for players hoping to play test cricket. The public expressed frustration over the absence of live coverage of the match, despite Sports18 having the Duleep Trophy rights, with many having hit social media for further prominence of such exciting events. As the tournament moves to the semi-finals, the spotlight will remain on Badoni\u2019s magical batting and Nabi\u2019s record feat.\n",

His recent return to England, however, raised a pressing question: has India underused him?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRising Talent Defined by All-Round Excellence\n\n\n\n\nIn 12 Test matches, Sundar has amassed 752 runs at an average of 44.23, including a Test-best unbeaten 101, alongside 32 wickets at an average of 28.46\u2014a rare dual impact.\n\n\n\nIn the 2024\u201325 home Test series against New Zealand, he was the joint-highest wicket-taker, claiming 16 wickets with sensational best innings figures of 7/59, matching Ravindra Jadeja in impact.\n\n\n\nIn T20Is, he\u2019s also delivered\u201448 wickets in 54 matches at an average of 23.50.\n\n\n\n\nThis rare blend of reliable spin and capable lower-order batting cements him as a genuine all-rounder\u2014one cricket greats believe is slipping through the cracks.\n\n\n\nWhat the Experts Say\n\n\n\nFormer India coach Ravi Shastri called Sundar a \u201cgenuine all-rounder for many, many years,\u201d crediting head coach Gautam Gambhir\u2019s faith and his own versatility across formats. Ravichandran Ashwin echoed that sentiment, confirming Gambhir \u201chighly rates\u201d him.\n\n\n\nSundar\u2019s recent performance at The Oval further emphasized his value. Batting at a critical juncture, he scored a rapid 53 off 46 balls\u2014launching India to a record narrow six-run win against England\u2014a knock coach Senthilnathan described as one that \u201cshattered England\u2019s momentum.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy Has He Been Underutilized?\n\n\n\n\nFitness Setbacks: Sundar\u2019s trajectory has been disrupted by frequent injuries\u2014from finger injuries and COVID to hamstring and shoulder issues. These have limited his consistent availability.\n\n\n\nLimited Opportunities Early On: After his Test debut in early 2021, he was sidelined for nearly 31 Test matches, only returning during the 2024 home series. That gap hindered rhythm development in red-ball cricket.\n\n\n\nTeam Composition & Balance: India has often opted for lineup combinations lighter on spin, especially at overseas venues. Sundar\u2019s inclusion has come only tactically when conditions favor his style.\n\n\n\n\nWas He Worth the Wait?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely. Sundar\u2019s recent dominance in England not only leaned on his skill but also on his mental resilience\u2014qualities essential in high-pressure games. He stepped up when India needed lower-order resistance and strategic breakthroughs, proving both his bowling and batting worth under global scrutiny.\n\n\n\nFor a changing Indian squad transitioning post the retirements of seniors like Kohli and Rohit, Sundar\u2019s versatility fills critical gaps in balance and adaptability.\n\n\n\nFinal Verdict: Underused, Not Ineffective\n\n\n\nIs Washington Sundar India\u2019s most underused all-rounder? The case is robust:\n\n\n\n\nElite domestic and international performances\n\n\n\nStrategic match-winning abilities\n\n\n\nExpert endorsements affirming his value\n\n\n\n\nYet, selection dynamics\u2014spanning fitness, team composition, and mere opportunity\u2014have often prevented him from establishing continuity. But with his recent form and rising credibility, his trajectory suggests India may finally be ready to build around him.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe Rajasthan Royals are going through a tough time. Head coach Rahul Dravid has stepped away, and captain Sanju Samson\u2019s future with the team is also in doubt. Losing both would leave a huge gap in leadership for the franchise.\n\n\n\nRahul Dravid\u2019s Exit\u2014A Big Loss\n\n\n\nRahul Dravid leaving his role as head coach has shocked the team and fans. His presence was not just about tactics; he played a big role in rebuilding the Royals. Reports suggest his exit was due to differences with the management. His departure leaves the team without a strong guiding figure.\n\n\n\nSanju Samson, who has been leading the Royals since 2021, is now considering a release or trade. The Kerala wicketkeeper-batter has been the face of the team for years, but uncertainty surrounds his future. Although his contract runs until 2027, the final call will come from the franchise.\n\n\n\nWho Can Lead the Rajasthan Royals Next?\n\n\n\nWith Dravid gone and Samson\u2019s position unsure, the Royals must decide on their next captain. Three names are being discussed: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, and Samson himself if he chooses to stay.\n\n\n\nYashasvi Jaiswal \u2013 The Rising Star\n\n\n\nAt 23, Jaiswal looks like the natural successor. He has already made his mark in all formats of the game. His energy, aggressive style, and international experience make him a strong option. However, taking on captaincy could also affect his batting, and that will be closely watched.\n\n\n\nRiyan Parag\u2014The Young Leader\n\n\n\nRiyan Parag brings leadership experience from domestic cricket, having captained Assam. He also led the Royals in three matches during the 2025 season when Samson was injured. Promoting him would be a bold step, but his confidence and leadership qualities could benefit the team.\n\n\n\nSanju Samson\u2014The Experienced Choice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamson remains the most experienced candidate. He guided the Royals to the IPL final in 2022 and has been consistent with the bat. But after five years as skipper, the team has not shown consistent dominance. Samson is also believed to be exploring options with other franchises, which raises questions about whether he will continue in the role.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Royals?\n\n\n\nThe Royals\u2019 management now faces a big decision\u2014choosing a new coach and captain. Experience, leadership skills, and team balance will all play a role in their choice. The outcome will shape the team\u2019s future direction.\n\n\n\nThe 2026 season could bring a fresh start for the Royals. With changes in both coaching and captaincy, the team must rebuild and focus again. Whether they rise stronger or struggle depends on how wisely the management handles these transitions.\n",

In the end, it was Pathum Nissanka\u2019s masterclass and Skipper Charith Asalnaka\u2019s calm aggression that lifted Sri Lanka to a five-wicket victory, sealing a 2-0. For Zimbabwe it was yet another tale of \u201d so close, yet so far.\u201d\n\n\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s promising start, Curran stands tall\n\n\n\nWinning the toss and choosing to field, Sri Lanka put Zimbabwe into bat. Considering the batting-friendly surface, it was a daring move. Zimbabwe \u2018s openers looked determined to make a statement. In the first ten overs. They raced to 55, forcing Sri Lanka\u2019s bowlers on the defensive.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of their innings stood Ben Curran with the patience, timing and sheer grit to carve out 79 off 95 balls. Curran\u2019s. Stokes down the ground, especially against the pacers, the Harre crowd has reason to believe. Brian Bennett chipped in with 21, and Breandon Taylor added 20 and while Zimbabwe \u2018s innings had balance. But cricket is a game of moments. In the 32nd over, Asitha Fernando turned the tide with two back-to-back\n\n\n\nBack strikes Curran and Skipper Sean Williams of Zimbabwe; they were suddenly staring at trouble.\n\n\n\nRaza, the rescuer yet again\n\n\n\nIf there\u2019s one man Zimbabwe turns to in moments of crisis, it\u2019s Sikandar Raza. And once again he answered his call. Walking in with his team wobbling, Raza counterattacked with elegance; his unbeaten 59 off 55 balls was laced with smart strike rotation and well-timed boundaries.\n\n\n\nPartnering with Clive Madande, who played a handy 36 off 36, stitched a 76-run and found its voice again.\n\n\n\nFor Sri Lanka, Dushmantha Chameera\u2019s three wickets were priceless, and Fernando\u2019s timely double blow changed the complexion of the innings.\n\n\n\nNissanka\u2019s Century of class\n\n\n\nChasing 278 was never going to be straightforward. Zimbabwe had runs on the board and bowlers hungry for wickets. But Pathum Nissanka, Sri Lanka\u2019s dependable opener, had other plans. His innings was a blend of patience and precision. Never hurried, never flustered, Nissanka absorbed pressure while punishing loose deliveries.\n\n\n\nHis 122 off 136 balls, including 16 boundaries, lit up Harae. Even as wickets kept tumbling around him. Nuwanidu Fernando for 14, Kusal Mendies for 5, and Sadeera Samarawickrama for 31. Nissanka kept his focus. Every time Zimbabwe sensed a window of opportunity. Nissanka shut it. His ability to rotate strike ensured Sri Lanka\u2019s scoreboard never stagnated.\n\n\n\nAsalnaka\u2019s captain knocks.s.\n\n\n\nThe pivotal moment came when Skipper Charith Asalanka joined Nissanka. The duo stitched together a 90-run partnership for the fourth wicket, tilting the balance firmly towards Sri Lanka. Asalnaka\u2019s 71 off 61 was an ideal counterbalance to Nissanka\u2019s dismissal with 42 needed. The skipper steadied nerves, carrying the chase close before falling with six runs left.\n\n\n\nZimbabwe fights Sri Lanka to finish\n\n\n\nFor Zimbabwe, there were positives: Curran\u2019s solid innings, Raza\u2019s consistency and fighting total. Yet once again they lacked the killer punch. For Sri Lanka, Nissanka \u2018 s Century and Asalanaka \u2018s leadership held their nerve in crunch moments. In Harree \u2018.s gripping clash , the visitors sealed the series walking away with confidence and silverware .\n",

Pole on Saturday, never gave it up on Sunday, and even bagged the fastest lap. A grand chelem, the kind of performance drivers remember for a lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t flashy. He didn\u2019t need to throw elbows or gamble on strategy. He just kept putting in lap after lap, neat and unshaken, while chaos unfolded behind him. If anyone doubted his title credentials, they won\u2019t anymore. This was the day Piastri looked like a world champion in waiting.\n\n\n\nSource: Reuters\n\n\n\nNorris \u2013 Hope Goes Up in Smoke\n\n\n\nLando Norris looked set for P2. For 60 laps, he shadowed his teammate, waiting for a mistake that never came. And then, without warning, the car betrayed him. Smoke. Flames. Silence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe pulled over, helmet slumped, knowing exactly what it meant: zero points. The kind of DNF that makes a season feel like it\u2019s slipping through your fingers. The gap in the championship is now 34 points. That\u2019s not impossible, but it\u2019s a mountain when the man ahead looks this sharp.\n\n\n\nThe Norris garage said nothing afterwards. Sometimes silence says it all.\n\n\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\n\n\nFerrari\u2019s Double Heartbreak\n\n\n\nLewis Hamilton had spoken all week about finding rhythm with Ferrari.

At 39 years and 239 days, the midfielder not only scored his first Premier League goal since 2019 but also became the oldest penalty scorer in the competition\u2019s history. Only Teddy Sheringham has found the net at an older age.\n\n\n\nSource \u2013 X.com\n\n\n\nFor Milner, though, the goal was less about personal milestones and more about honouring Jota. His cross-legged celebration instantly connected with Liverpool supporters watching from afar, many recognising it as a gesture of respect for the former No.20.\n\n\n\nThe Match Turned Brighton\u2019s Way\n\n\n\nBrighton, who had had a poor start to the season, displayed stamina against the champions of the day. With the equaliser by Milner, the Amex stadium was filled with faith and towards the end, in the 89th minute, Brajan Gruda sealed the turnaround with a late winner. The outcome provided Manchester City with two losses in a row and the first league victory to Brighton in the campaign.\n\n\n\nThe catalyst was the punishment that Milner received. His management and ability to remain calm during a crisis took fans back to what his career has been about in more than 20 years of his career.\n\n\n\nKeeping Jota\u2019s Legacy Alive\n\n\n\nMilner\u2019s decision to wear the No.20 shirt is more than a symbolic act. It represents a promise he made at Jota\u2019s funeral in Portugal \u2014 to keep his memory alive each time he steps on the pitch. For Liverpool fans, seeing one of their most respected former players carrying that legacy in Brighton colours adds another layer of meaning to his tribute.\n\n\n\nThe moment also highlighted the strength of football that transcends competition. Brighton was celebrating their win, but fans of other clubs could admire the kindness of the gesture made by Milner. His ambition, his partying, and his words together made the story of the season one of the most emotional stories in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nFinal Word\n\n\n\nTo James Milner the equaliser on Sunday was not just his first in a Brighton shirt. It was a tribute to a dead comrade, a show of fidelity, and a recollection of the reasons why he is still one of the most admired practitioners in English football. Three points went to Brighton, but the occasion had a weight much more than the scoreline, thanks to the tribute of Milner.\n",

The two teams are in good positions to start the game with San Diego leading the Western Conference with 53 points, and LAFC being in 5th place with 41.\n\n\n\nIt is an intense match-up. San Diego have not lost in their previous four league matches, and LAFC have not lost in five. Both teams will be playing compact football and will attack with the help of pace, so margins will be thin.\n\n\n\nHow to Watch\n\n\n\nFor fans in the United States, the match will stream live on Apple TV\u2019s MLS Season Pass. Kick-off is scheduled for 7:45 pm ET (4:45 pm PT) at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles. International viewers may need a VPN to access streams depending on regional restrictions.\n\n\n\nHappy Sonday. Watch LAFC vs. San Diego FC tonight on #MLSSeasonPass. pic.twitter.com/1RZ3w9vmr1\u2014 Apple TV (@AppleTV) August 31, 2025 \n\n\n\nTeam News: LAFC Adjustments\n\n\n\nLos Angeles FC come into the game with fitness and suspension issues. Aaron Long remains out with an Achilles injury, while Jeremy Ebobisse and Lorenzo Dellavalle are also unavailable. Veteran defender Maxime Chanot has retired after failing to recover from a head injury, and Ryan Hollingshead is suspended due to yellow card accumulation.\n\n\n\nOn a brighter note, Son Heung-min opened his MLS account last weekend with a well-taken goal, underlining his impact since joining from Tottenham. Denis Bouanga continues to be a key figure in attack, with 44 team goals scored this season highlighting LAFC\u2019s firepower.\n\n\n\nSan Diego\u2019s Defensive Steel\n\n\n\nSan Diego FC bring with them one of the league\u2019s standout goalkeepers. Carlos Joaquim Dos Santos secured his ninth clean sheet of the season against Portland, ranking him second in MLS. Despite a heavy injury list that includes Marcus Ingvartsen, Oscar Verhoeven, and William Kumado, head coach Mikey Varas has kept his team compact and efficient.\n\n\n\nReplacements Franco Negri, Luca de la Torre, Corey Baird, and Hirving Lozano were all handed starts against Portland and delivered enough to maintain the club\u2019s top spot. With 52 goals scored and only 33 conceded, San Diego are proving they can adapt even under pressure.\n\n\n\nForm Guide and Key Battles\n\n\n\nBoth sides carry strong form into this clash. LAFC drew 1-1 at Dallas after beating New England away, while San Diego held Portland before a string of three straight wins. The last head-to-head ended 3-2 to San Diego, showing their ability to punish mistakes quickly.\n\n\n\nThe duel between Son Heung-min and San Diego\u2019s Luca Bombino could define the attacking rhythm. In midfield, Marky Delgado and Onni Valakari will compete for control, while Dos Santos in goal faces one of his toughest nights of the campaign.\n\n\n\nStakes in the Standings\n\n\n\nFor LAFC, victory keeps them in the playoff mix and closes the gap on the top four. For San Diego, a win strengthens their hold on first place and pushes them closer to a Supporters\u2019 Shield bid in their debut season.\n\n\n\nBoth teams have the quality to win, but only one will take bragging rights in this all-California battle. Expect goals, intensity, and a crowd ready to push their team over the line.\n\n\n\nYou May Also Like \u2013 \n\n\n\n\nTottenham Refuse to Give Up on Manchester City Winger Savinho\n\n\n\nDurand Cup 2025 Final: Northeast United FC defend title with emphatic 6\u20131 victory\n\n\n\nManchester United Striker Matheus Cunha Suffers Injury Against Burnley\n\n\n\nAC Milan Secure Christopher Nkunku as Eighth Summer Signing\n\n\n\nMessi to India in November 2025: Kolkata Welcomes the World Champions\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nTottenham Hotspur are refusing to give up on Manchester City winger Savinho, even as the clock ticks down on the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old Brazilian has become a prime target for the North London side, who want to strengthen their attack following James Maddison\u2019s ACL injury.\n\n\n\nSpurs unveiled \u20ac60 million signing Xavi Simons before their last game, but his arrival has not closed the door on Savinho. The winger, who once played alongside Simons at PSV Eindhoven, is seen as the pace and width Tottenham\u2019s frontline currently lacks.\n\n\n\nSource \u2013 X.com\n\n\n\nCity, however, have resisted every approach. Reports confirm Spurs had bids of \u00a343 million and \u00a360 million rejected. Pep Guardiola has reportedly blocked the move, a stance that has left Savinho frustrated. The winger, still recovering from a pre-season injury, has yet to feature for City this season. Despite the pushback, Spurs remain determined. Journalist Graeme Bailey summed it up: \u201cSpurs love Savinho and are not letting this go\u2026 it is not dead in the water yet.\u201d\n\n\n\nAkanji Deal Looking More Likely\n\n\n\nWhile the Savinho chase hangs in the balance, Tottenham are also negotiating for City defender Manuel Akanji. An official \u00a320 million bid has already been submitted, outbidding AC Milan\u2019s \u20ac15 million offer. At 30, the Swiss international brings experience, and with City leaving him out of their last squad, a departure appears realistic.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Tottenham\u2019s move to sign Manchester City forward Savinho is not completely dead just yet.(Source: @GraemeBailey )It\u2019s the hope that kills you, Spurs fans. \ud83d\udc80 pic.twitter.com/T4ytzNfLAB\u2014 Transfer News Live (@DeadlineDayLive) August 31, 2025 \n\n\n\nSpurs\u2019 defensive need was highlighted in their 3-1 defeat at Bournemouth. Manager Thomas Frank already has Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, and new recruit Kevin Danso, but the squad lacks an additional ball-playing centre-back. Akanji fits the profile, and sources suggest City would be open to selling a squad defender if the price is right.\n\n\n\nWhy Spurs Are Pushing So Hard\n\n\n\nTottenham\u2019s urgency is driven by two key gaps. In attack, Maddison\u2019s long-term absence and failed pursuits of Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze have left a creative void. Savinho, with his explosive pace, is seen as the missing link to balance Simons\u2019 arrival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn defence, Akanji offers stability and leadership. The club does not want to enter the Champions League with depth concerns at the back. Spurs can also offer fringe City players what they lack in Manchester \u2014 guaranteed minutes in Europe\u2019s top competition without leaving the Premier League spotlight.\n\n\n\nThe Final Stretch\n\n\n\nWith less than 48 hours before the window closes, Spurs are \u201cworking overtime.\u201d Their persistence suggests at least one of these moves could still go through. Insider odds rate Akanji as a high-likelihood signing, while Savinho\u2019s deal sits at 50-50 due to City\u2019s reluctance and Girona\u2019s loan complications.\n\n\n\nStill, Tottenham\u2019s intent is clear. They are building for both domestic and European challenges, and they are willing to push until the very last hour. Whether it is Savinho, Akanji, or both, Spurs want to make a statement before the deadline slams shut.\n",

      "content_full": "\nFreelancing in cricket is a relatively recent phenomenon brought on by the franchise cricket boom of the modern cricketing landscape. Cricket does not revolve around the international circuit as it once did in the 90s. Today\u2019s fans are obsessed with franchise leagues around the world, where they can watch their favorite players team up or play against each other.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, outside of the Big Three countries (India, Australia and England), franchise leagues can pay bigger salaries to players than national boards. This is the primary reason for the emergence of the freelance cricketers who tour around the world playing for multiple franchises and not being affiliated with any international cricket teams.\n\n\n\nMoving from an international format to a Franchise format\n\n\n\nThe previous generation of cricket saw ODIs and white-ball cricket being the most popular phenomenon; the popularity of the World Cups and the shorter format of the game managed to capture the interests of audiences throughout the globe. This led to the popularity of bilateral ODI tours and Tri-Series tournaments.\n\n\n\nThe arrival and subsequent popularity of T20 as a format replaced ODIs as the most popular format in the 2010s. Franchise leagues also grew in popularity after the success of the IPL, which led to new leagues opening up around the globe. Today, the cricketing world offers an abundance of opportunities to play and earn their livelihood playing outside the international circuit.\n\n\n\nThe recent international retirement of Nicholas Pooran in his prime as an athlete demonstrates how players could choose to give the peak years of their athleticism to franchise cricket rather than international cricket, a notion that would have been unthinkable in the past. Playing in the international circuit is no longer the highest-paying job when it comes to cricket, and with franchise leagues upping the quality of cricket every year, the standard of cricket has almost risen to the same as that of the international level.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to be a freelance cricketer?\n\n\n\nTrent Boult rejected a New Zealand central contract to play Franchise cricket\n\n\n\nA freelance cricketer is an athlete who is not bound by national obligations and is free to play cricket around the world in franchise leagues. This essentially means declining a central contract when it comes to your national board (a route that Trent Boult and now Kane Williamson have taken) and choosing to play for franchise contracts around the world.\n\n\n\nWhile franchise contracts are more financially alluring than central contracts from national boards, it is upto the players themselves to manage their workloads and fitness. National setups have a proper setupconsisting of fitness personnel and coaches to manage players, their workloads and fitness, but for cricketing freelancers these responsibilities are left to themselves.\n\n\n\nThe practice of \u2018double dipping\u2019 for players (which basically means when players who are eliminated from one league travel across the world to play in another league that is being played simultaneously) paves the way for corruption in franchise leagues. Furthermore, lesser-known franchise teams may not be paying players or their support staff duly (as had been the case for Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the IPL).Freelance players need to manage which leagues they\u2019ll play, acquire contracts, and manage their workloads and fitness all by themselves. This makes it quite necessary for them to have agents who help them acquire contracts for different franchises around the world; players rely on their agents, which gives agents who are managing star players quite a lot of control over the global franchise circuit.\n\n\n\nAs R Ashwin retires from the IPL, he has expressed his desire to play in franchise leagues around the world. It will be interesting to see how the radical mind of Ashwin takes to the conditions and standards of the different franchise leagues around the world. The standards and conventions set in these cricket often lead the way and accelerate the evolution of the sport and the understanding of how T20 cricket is played.\n\n\n\nThe Future of Cricket\n\n\n\nAs cricket evolves past the international model into the Franchise model it resembles more and more a structure reminiscent of European club football, where these leagues are the most common form of the sport, interspersed only by World Cups. White ball cricket as it exists seems to be moving towards a similar direction.\n\n\n\nBilaterals are undervalued by star players today and are usually seen as an avenue to blood in new talent. Nicholas Pooran and Heinrich Klaasen, through their retirements, made a statement that even the top talent in the cricketing world is now preferring franchise cricket over their international duties largely due to the financial appeal.\n\n\n\nTo prevent further weakening of cricketing nations other than the Big Three countries, cricket needs to look for alternative models to the one that exists currently to ensure teams other than the Big Three have an equal chance of winning ICC white ball tournaments and so that cricket continues to evolve equally and not just to benefit the largest cricketing bodies.\n\n\n\n\n",

Moroccan forward Alaaeddine Ajaraie, awarded Man of the Match, exemplified this, while the journey of DHFC captivated the tournament\u2019s spirit of fresh narratives and regional hope.\n\n\n\nAs Indian football holds its breath for revival, this dual storyline, i.e., the champions\u2019 consolidation and the underdogs\u2019 rise, offers a compelling snapshot of the sport\u2019s shifting tides. And with the national team hitting the ground running in the CAFA Nations Cup 2025, Indian football\u2019s pulse seems to be quickening.\n\n\n\nEstablished in 1888, the Durand Cup is Asia\u2019s oldest football tournament, founded by the British-era Durand Football Tournament Society. Over more than a century, it has evolved from an army-centric competition to a national stage encompassing Indian Super League (ISL) teams, I-League clubs, armed forces squads, state associations, and foreign invitees. The 134th edition of 2025 was hosted across five cities: Kolkata, Shillong, Jamshedpur, Imphal, and Kokrajhar, comprising 24 teams and delivering 147 goals across 43 matches.\n\n\n\nNEUFC\u2019s defense of the title recalls East Bengal\u2019s hat-trick run in 1989\u20131991, making this feat both rare and symbolic. For NEUFC, their journey from ISL also-rans to Durand royalty underscores a strategic shift under coach Juan Pedro Benali, a period of transformation that began with their first-ever Durand title in 2024 and continued through ISL playoff qualifications and Super Cup campaigns.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Diamond Harbour FC, a relative newcomer, captured hearts with a Cinderella run that disrupted traditional hierarchies of Indian club football, a testament to the Durand\u2019s unique ability to spotlight rising voices in a crowded ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoad to the Final\n\n\n\nNortheast United FC: Metronomic Mastery\n\n\n\nNEUFC\u2019s campaign reflected coherence, ambition, and execution:\n\n\n\n\nGroup Stage (Group E): They topped their group undefeated, with key victories over armed forces sides and Shillong Lajong, laying a foundation of authority.\n\n\n\nQuarter-final: Overwhelming Bodoland FC 4\u20130, signaling their intent early in the knockout rounds.\n\n\n\nSemi-final: In a poised display, Redeem Tlang\u2019s majestic long-range strike secured a narrow win over Shillong Lajong, confirming NEUFC\u2019s place in the final and showcasing their mettle under duress.\n\n\n\n\nWith Ajaraie, Parthib Gogoi, Emil Benny, Mirshad Michu, and others peaking at crucial junctures, NEUFC built momentum that carried them into the final as a unit in full ascendancy.\n\n\n\nDiamond Harbour FC: From Debut to Final Dream\n\n\n\nDiamond Harbour\u2019s story was the tournament\u2019s biggest surprise:\n\n\n\n\nGroup Stage (Group B): As runners-up behind Mohun Bagan SG, DHFC advanced through consistency and grit.\n\n\n\nQuarter-final: A stunning 2\u20130 victory over Jamshedpur FC, taken by a team with less than half the pedigree.\n\n\n\nSemi-final: A clever, gritty 2\u20131 win over East Bengal FC sent shockwaves through Kolkata and validated their finals berth.\n\n\n\n\nTheir road reflected a blend of tactical discipline, defensive resilience, and opportunism that earned them national acclaim and a place in Indian football\u2019s evolving narrative.\n\n\n\nTactical Analysis\n\n\n\nNEUFC embodied a balance between structure and flair harmonized:\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Control: Possession-friendly yet incisive. NEUFC\u2019s build-up was measured, waiting to strike through velocity, combinations, or Ajaraie\u2019s predatory instincts.\n\n\n\nFlank Firepower: With Emil Benny weaving through midfield and Ajaraie finding pockets in the box, NEUFC systematically dismantled defenses.\n\n\n\nGame Management: Quarter-final thumping translated into semi-final composure, showing adaptability against compact threats.\n\n\n\n\nDHFC, by contrast, relied on a classic underdog blueprint:\n\n\n\n\nMulti-layered compactness: Refusing to be bullied, they defended labyrinthine blocks, turning pressure into counter threats.\n\n\n\nSet-Piece Duels: Their semifinals win came with disciplined marking and execution from dead-ball situations.\n\n\n\nPsychological Momentum: Every upset over Jamshedpur and East Bengal built belief that served them until the final.\n\n\n\n\nIn the final, though, the gulf in depth, cohesion, and attacking variety became too vast and NEUFC\u2019s structure unmoored DHFC\u2019s resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Statistics\n\n\n\nCategoryAwardeesTop ScorerAlaaeddine Ajaraie (NEUFC)Top AssistsSahal Abdul Samad (MBSG)Clean SheetsAmrit Gope (JFC)Golden GloveGurmeet Singh (NEUFC)Golden BallAlaaeddine Ajaraie (NEUFC)Golden BootAlaaeddine Ajaraie (NEUFC)Tournament Goals147\n\n\n\nNEUFC recorded six different scorers in the final, underscoring their attacking depth and collective strength.

NEUFC\u2019s faithful paired with local football connoisseurs made it an electric evening.\n\n\n\nRegional Grounds Alive: Matches in Shillong, Jamshedpur, Imphal, and Kokrajhar drew fervent local followings, underlining Durand\u2019s connection to communities beyond metropolitan centers.\n\n\n\nMilitary Flair: With armed forces teams participating, stadiums echoed with military band echoes, ceremonial tones, and institutional pride.\n\n\n\nMedia Reach: Broadcasters like Sony Sports Network and Jio TV brought matches to fans across the country, reinforcing the Cup\u2019s visibility.\n\n\n\nHope Amid Struggle: Many commentators, like the Times of India, described NEUFC\u2019s win as a \u201cglimmer of hope in troubled times\u201d for Indian football, amplifying emotional resonance.\n\n\n\n\nFuture of the Indian Football\n\n\n\nSimultaneously, Indian football\u2019s international prospects are stirring. Under new head coach Khalid Jamil, the national senior team began their CAFA Nations Cup 2025 campaign with a notable 2\u20131 away win over Tajikistan. Goals from defenders Anwar Ali and Sandesh Jhingan gave India an early lead, while Gurpreet Singh Sandhu delivered a crucial penalty save, traits of a compact, disciplined unit.\n\n\n\nThis victory not only defied expectations, Tajikistan being higher ranked, but also marked the following:\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s first competitive win since November 2023,\n\n\n\nFirst victory under Jamil\u2019s leadership,\n\n\n\nReturn of defensive organization and resilience.\n\n\n\n\nIt set a confident tone for the national side heading into group-stage matches against Iran and Afghanistan, suggesting an era of stabilizing performance on the international front.\n\n\n\nFrom Legacy to Momentum: 134th Durand Cup 2025 Overview\n\n\n\nThe 134th Durand Cup is far more than a tournament; it\u2019s a narrative canvas. Here, Northeast United FC\u2019s back-to-back title defense reflects strategic evolution, team unity, and regional resurgence. Diamond Harbour FC\u2019s unlikely ascent speaks to new voices, ambition, and the widening landscape of Indian club football.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParallelly, the national team\u2019s composed start under Khalid Jamil signifies institutional maturity, defensive solidity, and fresh belief at the international level.\n\n\n\nFrom the Salt Lake Stadium\u2019s cauldron to the dusty plains of Central Asia, India\u2019s football ecosystem hums with potential. The 2025 season may yet be remembered not only for trophies, but for renewal of heritage, of hope, and of a trajectory pointing upwards.\n",

So far he had been as active as possible, making one opportunity, and challenging the goalkeeper with a shot on goal.\n\n\n\nRuben Amorim's reaction says it all when Matheus Cunha went down injured \ud83e\udd15 pic.twitter.com/UvJNAjQKpX\u2014 OneFootball (@OneFootball) August 30, 2025 \n\n\n\nA Brutal Week for Matheus Cunha\n\n\n\nThis setback comes at the worst possible time for the 26-year-old. Earlier in the week, he missed the decisive penalty in United\u2019s shock Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby, a fourth-division side. That result was already described as one of the club\u2019s most humiliating nights. Now, just days later, Cunha faces the frustration of being sidelined, leaving fans worried about his future impact.\n\n\n\nSource \u2013 X.com\n\n\n\nSigned from Wolves for \u00a362.5 million this summer, Cunha had started all four of United\u2019s matches under Ruben Amorim. While still searching for his first goal or assist, his pace and energy had already made him a fan favourite, particularly after his impressive display against Arsenal. This injury threatens to interrupt the momentum he was beginning to build.\n\n\n\nUnited\u2019s Plans in Jeopardy\n\n\n\nThe injury could not come at a worse time for Ruben Amorim. With the Manchester derby against City set for September 14, Cunha\u2019s availability is now in serious doubt. He could also miss key fixtures against Chelsea and Brentford, and possibly even the clash with Liverpool on October 19. For a side still adjusting under their new manager, losing a record signing is a massive blow.\n\n\n\nUnited\u2019s medical team will run scans to confirm the severity of the hamstring damage. Early signs suggest several weeks out, though a clearer picture will only emerge after assessment. Amorim, already short on options, now faces the challenge of reshaping his attack without one of his most important players.\n\n\n\nBrazil Left Short-Handed\n\n\n\nThe shock goes beyond Manchester. Brazil had called Cunha in to play against Chile and Bolivia in their world cup qualifiers. His injury virtually disqualifies him and coach Carlo Ancelotti is left scrambling to find someone to replace him. Brazil already lost Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, who rest and Neymar is injured. Ancelotti has already been forced to change his squad several times, and the injury of Cunha is another name on the list of absent players.\n\n\n\nSmall Glimpse of Positives\n\n\n\nTo United fans, there was at least one good news. Noussair Mazraoui also came back to the team after overcoming his own hamstring issue and provided Amorim with a bit of depth on defence. Lisandro Martinez is the only other first-team player unavailable, but the situation of Cunha has now become the most urgent.\n\n\n\nThe coming days will reveal the true scale of the damage, but the early signs are worrying. For a player who had just begun to win supporters with his energy, this injury feels like a cruel twist of fate. United\u2019s season, still in its opening weeks, has already been handed its first major test.\n",

To make the move happen, Nkunku accepted a pay cut, earning under \u20ac5 million per year.\n\n\n\nChelsea Struggles and Missed Chances\n\n\n\nNkunku\u2019s two years in London were marked by frustration. He scored 18 goals and provided 5 assists in 62 games, but he only started 11 Premier League matches. His progress was stalled early by a knee injury in pre-season, and he never regained his full rhythm. Under Enzo Maresca, he mostly featured in Conference League matches, scoring against lower-level opposition but missing out on the league\u2019s biggest stages.\n\n\n\nDespite limited time, he left Chelsea with two trophies: the UEFA Conference League and the FIFA Club World Cup. Yet, his \u00a360 million arrival from RB Leipzig never matched expectations, leaving fans wondering what could have been.\n\n\n\nMilan\u2019s Big Gamble\n\n\n\nFor Milan, this is a bold investment. Nkunku becomes their joint-second most expensive signing ever, tied with Leonardo Bonucci\u2019s 2017 move. Only Rafael Le\u00e3o\u2019s \u20ac49.5 million arrival cost more. Nkunku is also Milan\u2019s eighth signing of the summer.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd34\u26ab\ufe0f\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 Official, confirmed. Christopher Nkunku joins AC Milan from Chelsea on \u20ac37m fee plus \u20ac5m add-ons and sell-on.Nkunku signed a contract until June 2030.Here with his agent Humberto Paiva from Pini Zahavi\u2019s Gol International. pic.twitter.com/iT5jgM0oZL\u2014 Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) August 30, 2025 \n\n\n\nThe Rossoneri had chased other forwards like Victor Boniface and Conrad Harder but failed to land them. In Nkunku, they see a player who once dominated the Bundesliga with 70 goals for Leipzig and a Golden Boot in 2022/23. If he stays fit, he could become a game-changer in Serie A.\n\n\n\nChelsea\u2019s Transfer Shake-Up\n\n\n\nFor Chelsea, this sale fits a larger plan. The club has raised over \u20ac320 million this summer, balancing books after a UEFA fine and creating room for new signings. With Nkunku gone, they are pushing for Alejandro Garnacho in a \u20ac40 million move, while Nicolas Jackson heads to Bayern Munich on loan.\n\n\n\nNkunku joins a growing list of former Chelsea men at Milan\u2014Pulisic, Loftus-Cheek, and Tomori. Now, his task is clear: to rebuild his career in Italy and prove he can still deliver on the big stage.\n",

      "content_full": "\nPakistan made a tremendous statement in the debut match of the UAE T20I Tri-Series 2025, defeating Afghanistan with ease by 39 runs at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on August 29. With skipper Salman Agha scoring a brutal, unbeaten half-century and Haris Rauf recording an impactful bowling spell that included two wickets on the trot, Pakistan once again displayed their depth and resilience against their great rival, Afghanistan, as they prepare notions of what is in store for the Asia Cup.\n\n\n\nAfter Afghanistan stumbled to chase a big total of 183, they produced a late blitz led by Rashid Khan, who made it interesting as the wickets fell. Even with the excitement late, this match was a microcosm of the larger rivalry; one team with all-round capabilities against a single threat. \n\n\n\nThis loss drops Afghanistan down in points to start the series against a host in the UAE to complete the tri-series. It will be advantageous as Pakistan sees increased confidence ahead of the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup again in 2026.\n\n\n\nSalman Agha\u2019s Masterclass Powers Pakistan to Formidable Total\n\n\n\nPakistan opted to bat first after winning the toss on a pitch in Sharjah that was conducive to aggressive strokeplay. They certainly made a fast assessment of their batting might with Farhan providing the fireworks with a rapid fire (21 off 10) and hitting a six and a four in the very first over. \n\n\n\nBy the end of the powerplay, Pakistan were in a good position on 54/1. Afghanistan\u2019s spinners fought back, reducing Pakistan\u2019s good start to 63/3, as Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi dismissed Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman, just what Afghanistan needed.\n\n\n\nCaptain Salman Agha, who rewrote the scoreboard with an unbeaten 53 from 36 balls that contained three fours and three sixes, showcased his aggressive yet measured approach. Agha tackled tough pitch conditions in the early part of his innings but unleashed holy fury for the final part of his innings. \n\n\n\nAgha also combined with Mohammad Nawaz for a sequence-changing 52-run partnership to increase the run-rate and ensure Pakistan made 180 runs. Contributions from the lower order, via Mohammad Haris and Faheem Ashraf, who scored 50 runs in 29 balls, contributed to the final score of 182/7.\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s Promising Start Crumbles Under Pressure\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s chase began with a clear intent, seeking to strike a balance between caution and aggression, in their attempt to remain in the contest. Opener Gurbaz rolled back in with a hurried 38 off 27 balls with a couple of sixes and was able to keep the required rate in check during the powerplay. \n\n\n\nWith support from Ibrahim Zadran and Sediqullah Atal. Afghanistan were 93/2 in the 11th over, giving the impression that they had power hitters from the lower order that could fire them up for a late surge.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the innings collapsed spectacularly in an implosion that shifted the momentum toward Pakistan so heavily that no amount of hitting would change the result for the Afghans. \n\n\n\nAfghanistan found themselves in a confident position, but then simply went to pieces, losing 5 wickets for 4 runs in 16 balls, sinking to 97/7. The team\u2019s fragility in chases is alarming; even though the team had choices of matches in ICC events, managing chases has been a problem area for Afghanistan consistently. Once Gurbaz was bowled by Nawaz in the sweep attempt, the middle order could never start rotating the strike again, and surrendered to the pressure of the dot-ball.\n\n\n\nRauf\u2019s Double-Wicket Maiden: The Turning Point\n\n\n\nThe defining moment of the game came in the 12th over when Haris Rauf bowled a double-wicket maiden, which shattered Afghanistan\u2019s backbone. Rauf was consistently running near 150kph, dismissing Atal and Karim Janat on two consecutive deliveries, and built significant pressure with hard-length deliveries with pace. Simply by virtue of that over, Afghanistan fell apart as they scored only 6 runs in the next 24 balls while losing 5 wickets.\n\n\n\nRauf ended with a fantastic return of 4-31, including the important dismissals of Rashid and Fareed Ahmad in the death overs. He was well supported by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Mohammad Nawaz, and Sufiyan Muqeem (2-25), who all bowled within their means in different phases of the innings.\n\n\n\n Muqeem\u2019s quick wickets of Darwish Rasooli and Mohammad Nabi produced further collapse, and Nawaz\u2019s stumping of Omarzai (0) completed the destruction of the middle order. Pakistan\u2019s bowlers worked well without the dew factor, making it difficult for batters and also demonstrating their skills on a Sharjah surface that is unpredictable.\n\n\n\nRashid Khan\u2019s Explosive Cameo Falls Short\n\n\n\nIn a brief moment of spark, Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan raised the hopes of fans with a quickfire 39 off 16, which included one four and five sixes in a desperate counter-attack.\u00a0 It got the equation down a little bit, but too little too late for him. Finally, he was dismissed, caught at deep backward square leg by Rauf. Afghanistan would end up bowled out for 143 runs in 19.5 overs.\n\n\n\nAfter the match, Rashid said, \u201cWe lost so many wickets in the middle overs, and that cost us. Rotating strike is key in T20s.\u201d Despite his heroics, the earlier collapse proved insurmountable, underscoring Afghanistan\u2019s need to address momentum shifts in chases.\n\n\n\nFor Afghanistan, the defeat is disappointing but provides lessons for their matches with the UAE and the Asia Cup. Rashid said, \u201cWe are aiming to play our brand of cricket and that\u2019s with 200 percent effort.\u201d Pakistan plays the UAE in their next match on August 30, eyeing the final of the tri-series on September 7.\n\n\n\nIn a fiercely competitive rivalry, Pakistan\u2019s clinical performance reasserted its position as T20 blood tests, with a mix of experience and young stars for victories to come.\n",

In the 5th minute, Muhammed Uvais unleashed a thunderous throw-in that caused chaos in the box; amidst the scramble, Anwar Ali glided in and nodded home India\u2019s first goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust eight minutes later, the momentum surged again. Anwar Ali swung in another dangerous ball from the flank, Rahul Bheke\u2019s header was parried, and Sandesh Jhingan pounced on the rebound, planting it into the net to make it 2-0. In under a quarter of an hour, the script was written: nerves were calm, belief was high. \n\n\n\nSource: AIFF\n\n\n\nTajikistan Strikes Back\n\n\n\nTajikistan refused to fold. In the 23rd minute, Shahrom Samiev was unleashed between India\u2019s defensive lines and coolly flicked a shot past Gurpreet Singh Sandhu to halve the deficit. The Blue Tigers once glowing with early dominance had a scare. But rather than crumble, they dug in.\n\n\n\nSource: AIFF\n\n\n\nTactical Resilience: Jamil\u2019s Blueprint and Defensive Resolve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Jamil, India\u2019s 4-4-1-1 transitioned into a fortress by the second half. Tajikistan dominated possession and territory, piling on pressure but the Blue Tigers absorbed it with steel. Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, back in goal, was a giant diving, shouting, owning his box. The big moment came in the 69th: a penalty. Fans at tea stalls back home froze. He stretched, guessed right, and batted it away. Pure defiance.\n\n\n\n\nGurpreet: India's Impenetrable Wall \ud83e\uddf1#TJKIND #CAFANationsCup2025 #IndianFootball pic.twitter.com/s1NjvJnRw6\u2014 FanCode (@FanCode) August 29, 2025\n\n\n\n\nThen came fresh legs. Naorem Mahesh Singh ran hard, sparked counters, even made the Tajik keeper work. By the end, when the whistle finally cut through, it wasn\u2019t calm relief. It was noise, it was pride, it was euphoria.\n\n\n\nSource: Indian Express\n\n\n\nMan of the Match: Gurpreet Singh Sandhu \u2013 The Hero Between the Sticks\n\n\n\n\nThey don't call him the wall for no reason \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\ude0c@GurpreetGK \ud83e\udde4#TJKIND #CAFANationsCup2025 #BlueTigers #IndianFootball \u26bd pic.twitter.com/x9Wu3CkuLc\u2014 Indian Football Team (@IndianFootball) August 29, 2025\n\n\n\n\nWhile Anwar and Jhingan wrote the early chapters, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu was the guardian of the ending. A captain\u2019s performance by nature and necessity, he delivered a penalty save, several world-class stops, and unwavering leadership deep in his box. Without him, the win could easily have slipped away; with him, India claimed a statement.\n\n\n\nHope Rekindled, Pride Reborn\n\n\n\nFor Blue Tigers fans, this was more than a match it was a three-year wait ending. As one report puts it:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was India\u2019s first victory in nearly two years away from home\u2026 the 133rd-ranked side enjoyed one of its finest nights\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nThe crowd may have been sparse, but hearts roared. Be it the die-hard in a remote town or a youngster glued to the TV seeing India gritty, disciplined, and bold again stirred pride, belief, and passion that football dreams are reborn. This victory is not just on the scoreline it\u2019s in every fan\u2019s chest.\n\n\n\nTactical Summary: Jamil\u2019s Balanced Gameplan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTactical ElementDescriptionSet-piece weaponUvais\u2019s throw-ins became aerial chaos Anwar and Jhingan capitalized early\u00a0 .Shape and disciplineDefence held firm under siege; midfield pressed just enough to cut passing lanes.Experience and composureVeteran defenders and goalkeeper stood tall. Substitutes added fresh legs and decision-making late on.Emotional leadershipJamil\u2019s calm demeanour, post-goal adjustments, and belief instilled calm under pressure.\n\n\n\nWhat This Means for India and What Comes Next\n\n\n\nThis 2-1 win is not an endpoint it\u2019s a launchpad. It\u2019s the bold signature of Khalid Jamil, the echo of chants in Indian hearts, and a message to Group B rivals like Iran and Afghanistan: India are back, and they are battling not just for results, but for redemption.\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at India's schedule for the CAFA Nations Cup 2025! #IndianFootball #IndianFootballTeam #BlueTigers pic.twitter.com/v9lUZS3ZyF\u2014 Khel Now (@KhelNow) August 25, 2025\n\n\n\n\nIndia will next face Iran on September 1, and this win sets a powerful tone.

However, Tottenham moved decisively and sealed a deal worth \u00a351.8 million, giving Simons a five-year contract with an option for two more seasons.\n\n\n\nDespite their long-standing interest, Chelsea never placed an official bid. That hesitation proved costly, as Spurs secured one of Europe\u2019s most exciting young talents.\n\n\n\nWhat Chelsea Lose by Missing Simons\n\n\n\nSimons would have provided Chelsea with immediate top-level quality. At 21, he already has experience at international level and has shown versatility across midfield and attacking roles. His ability to deliver creativity, goals, and pressing intensity would have added instant strength to Chelsea\u2019s squad.\n\n\n\nLMAO XAVI SIMMONS REJECTED CHELSEA FOR SPURS\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/kRTvpCyLNp\u2014 (fan) Trey (@UTDTrey) August 29, 2025 \n\n\n\nThe Dutchman also represented long-term stability. Investing in him meant securing a player who could serve the club for the next decade. Missing out on that type of profile leaves Chelsea without the kind of guaranteed performer who can elevate both domestic and European ambitions.\n\n\n\nFinancially, Chelsea may have been cautious. The \u00a351.8m fee plus wages would have been another heavy commitment after significant spending elsewhere, including the \u00a340m outlay for Alejandro Garnacho. While restraint made sense in balancing the books, it also meant ceding ground to Tottenham, who now look stronger with Simons in their ranks.\n\n\n\nChelsea Turn to Facundo Buonanotte\n\n\n\nChelsea grabbed Facundo Buonanotte off Brighton in a short time with Simons off the market. Sky Sports and Fabrizio Romano reported the deal, and it is only a loan- no buy-out. The personal stuff is all sorted, so he ought to be with the Blues before the window closes on Monday.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udca3 EXCLUSIVE: Chelsea are working on deal to sign Facundo Buonanotte from Brighton.Negotiations underway with Brighton for Argentine talent in the list of several clubs in UK, Borussia Dortmund and more.Deal on. \ud83d\udd35\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 pic.twitter.com/x4u7b4rX2h\u2014 Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) August 29, 2025 \n\n\n\nThat Argentine is just 20 and already played 50 games with Brighton and contributed with seven goals and assists. He had even a loan spell at Leicester last season and scored six goals and three assists proving that he could jump in and make an impact any time.\n\n\n\nWhat Buonanotte Offers Chelsea\n\n\n\nBuonanotte is primarily a number 10 but is comfortable playing wide, offering flexibility in attacking positions. His ability to create and finish makes him a useful option behind Chelsea\u2019s new-look forward line of Estevao Willian, Joao Pedro, and Liam Delap.\n\n\n\nUnlike Simons, Buonanotte is not yet a proven international star. He has two senior caps for Argentina, but his reputation is still developing. For Chelsea, that means he arrives with plenty of potential and a point to prove, but not the same guaranteed impact Simons would have delivered.\n\n\n\nThe loan structure also limits the long-term benefits. Brighton refused to insert a purchase option, meaning Buonanotte will return to the south coast next summer regardless of his success at Stamford Bridge. For Chelsea, it is a short-term solution to fill depth rather than a foundational signing.\n\n\n\nComparing Simons and Buonanotte\n\n\n\nThe contrast is clear. Simons is an established, Champions League-ready player who could have been a cornerstone for Chelsea\u2019s future. Buonanotte, by comparison, is a developmental talent who brings depth, creativity, and versatility without financial risk.\n\n\n\nChelsea lose the certainty of quality with Simons but gain a young, motivated player on a low-cost deal. In the short term, Buonanotte provides options and energy in a busy schedule. In the long term, however, the club may look back at Simons as the bigger missed opportunity.\n\n\n\nFinal Outlook\n\n\n\nSummer has been a juggle of big-money deals and calculated moves at Chelsea. Playing out on Simons demonstrates the difficulty of matching the best clubs. Snagging Buonanotte, however, is a play that still plays like a practical one, without bursting the budget.\n\n\n\nWith the loan of the Argentine nearing its end, Chelsea supporters will be doing the trade-off: lose a star player, gain a young prospect who might yet prove himself this season.\n\n\n\n\n",

Cole we need to see day by day, and the other two I don\u2019t think will be back after the international break, but they will be closer.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlongside Palmer, defender Benoit Badiashile and midfielder Romeo Lavia will also miss the derby, leaving Chelsea short in key areas.\n\n\n\nExtent of Palmer\u2019s Injury\n\n\n\nPalmer underwent a scan on his groin earlier this week, which revealed the issue is not as severe as initially feared. However, medical staff have advised caution, ruling him out until after the international break.\n\n\n\nEnzo Maresca confirms Cole Palmer is OUT for Chelsea's Gameweek 3 fixture against Fulham! \u274c pic.twitter.com/HFazlaq5eX\u2014 Fantasy Premier League (@OfficialFPL) August 29, 2025 \n\n\n\nThe injury already forced him to withdraw from the England squad for their World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. England boss Thomas Tuchel decided against including him after consulting with Maresca. The Chelsea coach confirmed:\u201cI spoke with Thomas a few times, but in the end it was his decision. Cole is not available tomorrow, so it shows he has some problem.\u201d\n\n\n\nReplacing Palmer in the Line-Up\n\n\n\nWithout Palmer, Chelsea will likely stick with the same front line that faced West Ham. Estevao Willian replaced him on the night and impressed, playing behind Liam Delap with Joao Pedro also in attack.\n\n\n\nMaresca acknowledged the difference Palmer makes but insisted the squad has solutions:\u201cFor sure, we are a much better team with Cole. But when Cole is not in the game, we need to find different solutions. Last week we found them, and hopefully tomorrow we can again.\u201d\n\n\n\nEstevao\u2019s performance has given fans some encouragement, though Palmer\u2019s creativity and experience remain irreplaceable.\n\n\n\nOther Absentees: Lavia and Badiashile\n\n\n\nMidfielder Romeo Lavia and defender Benoit Badiashile continue their recovery and will also sit out the derby. Both have struggled with injuries across the past year, and Maresca suggested their return will be managed carefully.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith Romeo and Benoit, it\u2019s normal after a long time out that they need sessions and minutes. It\u2019s the same we did with Wesley Fofana. Hopefully when they are back, they can be fit for a long time.\u201d\n\n\n\nChelsea must once again adjust their defensive and midfield balance without these two options.\n\n\n\nLooking Beyond Fulham\n\n\n\nThe derby against Fulham comes just before the September international break, giving Chelsea two weeks to regroup. Palmer is expected to return for the Premier League trip to Brentford on September 13 if his recovery continues smoothly.\n\n\n\nThe timing is important, as Chelsea face a demanding run. Their Champions League campaign begins after the Brentford match, with Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Benfica among their group stage opponents.\n\n\n\nMaresca admitted the draw was challenging but welcomed the test:\u201cWe are happy to be in the draw. It is always difficult, but it is nice to be there.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat It Means for Chelsea\n\n\n\nPalmer\u2019s absence is a setback, but Chelsea showed against West Ham that they can still score freely without him. The responsibility now shifts to Estevao, Delap, and Pedro to maintain that attacking spark.\n\n\n\nFor Fulham, Palmer\u2019s absence removes Chelsea\u2019s most consistent attacking threat, but Marco Silva\u2019s side will still have to deal with a confident Chelsea team coming off a dominant away win.\n\n\n\nChelsea\u2019s medical team will monitor Palmer daily, but the club is prioritising his long-term fitness. With high-stakes fixtures ahead, they cannot afford to risk their key forward too soon.\n",

Veteran players, current players, plus some important people and fans, all showed up. The occasion marked the celebrations of the trailblazers who set the stage and identified the current stars who have taken the game to heights never before imagined.\n\n\n\nWhat a fantastic celebration of women's cricket today, marking 50 days to go until the @cricketworldcup. This promises to be the biggest women's cricket event ever and it all begins on September 30. #CWC25 pic.twitter.com/B9r4OxooIx\u2014 Jay Shah (@JayShah) August 11, 2025\n\n\n\nBeginning of this glory:\n\n\n\nIndian Women\u2019s cricket started its way in the year 1973 with the formation of the Women\u2019s Cricket Association of India (WCAI) in Lucknow, and, in this manner, organised women\u2019s cricket in India began. Its founder-secretary was Mahendra Kumar Sharma, who organized interstate competitions, such as the first Women\u2019s Inter-State Nationals in Pune and the Inter-Zonal Rani Jhansi Trophy in Kanpur the same year. In 1978, the WCAI came to the forefront in the international arena with its membership in the International Women\u2019s Cricket Council and government recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 1975, the first official home international match to be hosted in India was when the Australian under-25 team visited India. In October and November 1976, the history of first women\u2019s Test series took place and was a series of six Test matches against the West Indies. The first ever Test match was won by India on November 19 at Patna in front of over 25000 spectators, and this has created an atmosphere of considerable interest and excitement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport from Institutions and Expanding Infrastructure:\n\n\n\nIn 2006, WCAI and the Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) merged. This integration made better finance, central contracts, more enhanced domestic competitions, and more visibility of Indian Women\u2019s Cricket. To help Indian women\u2019s cricket grow strong, women cricketers from India now play in organized tournaments like the Senior Women\u2019s One Day League, T20 League, and age-group matches here at home.\n\n\n\nNotable Moments on the International Stage:\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s getting noticed worldwide, which is reflected in their two stunning performances to the Women\u2019s World Cup finals:\n\n\n\n\nBack in 2005, Mithali Raj helped India reach the finals, and that drew considerable attention to women\u2019s cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey performed exceptionally well again in 2017 after a series of awesome games. Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s crazy 171 against Australia really put women\u2019s cricket into the limelight across India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia has reached the T20 semifinals a few times too. On the regional level, India managed to secure the women\u2019s Asia Cup seven times in a row. Moreover, the team has gained silver at the 2022 Commonwealth Games and gold at the 2022 Asian Games, which promoted the supporting mood and perceptions on Indian Women\u2019s Cricket.\n\n\n\nThe Beginning of WPL :\n\n\n\nThe Women\u2019s Premier League (WPL) kicked off in 2023, which was a major milestone for Indian Women\u2019s Cricket. With media rights sold to Viacom18 for approximately \u20b9951 crore (~US$116 million) and franchise rights selling for about \u20b94,670 crore (~US$572 million), it gave Indian Women\u2019s Cricket financial clout and international recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Mithali Raj, the WPL was a turning point that improved chances and professional standards for female cricket players. Many emerging young players made headlines, and the league serves as a crucial audition for national selection.\n\n\n\nThe Stars of Indian Cricket and their records:\n\n\n\nHarmanpreet Kaur, the Indian women\u2019s cricket team captain and a fantastic all-rounder, really shows how much progress they\u2019ve made. By August 2025, she\u2019d scored 4,069 runs in 149 ODI games.. Her average was 37.67; she scored 19 half-centuries and 7 centuries, and her best score was 171. Also, she\u2019s the only Indian woman with more than 3,000 runs in T20I, with a total of 3,654 runs. Here are some other Indian Women\u2019s Cricket team players who made history:\n\n\n\n\nJhulan Goswami: The Indian legend, also known as the Chakdaha Express, is the top ODI wicket-taker. She took 255 ODI wickets out of her 355 international wickets. Now that she\u2019s retired, she\u2019s helping young bowlers get better.\n\n\n\nMithali Raj: She inspired a new generation by leading India to the 2005 and 2017 World Cup finals and scoring 7,805 ODI runs, including 7 centuries and 64 fifties, making\u00a0her the face of Indian women\u2019s cricket for over\u00a020 years.\n\n\n\nSmriti Mandhana: She\u2019s the first female Indian cricketer to score a century in every game format. She also scored the most T20I runs in a year (763) and racked up the most international runs in a single calendar year (1,602).\n\n\n\nShafali Verma: She holds the record of the quickest Test century (113 balls), quickest Test double hundred (205 in 194 balls), and quickest opening partnership with Mandhana.\n\n\n\nDeepti Sharma and Punam Raut: In 2017, the Indian women\u2019s cricket and men\u2019s ODI opening record was broken as Deepti Sharma and Punam Raut made history with an amazing record of 320 runs opening stand with Ireland. Deepti also established a record in the match when she scored 188 runs individually, and that remains the highest score by an Indian woman in an ODI.\n\n\n\nJemimah Rodrigues: She has over 1,900+ T20Is and 1,200+ ODI runs and is an emergent star who contributed to the 2022 Commonwealth Games silver medal. She is the star of the WPL in the Delhi Capitals and was considered the future leader of the team.\n\n\n\n\nThe history of Indian Women\u2019s Cricket has seen cricket evolve to a high level of interest across the world within the time span of 1975-2025. Institutional support, creative performances, business innovations, and cultural changes have made it a force of pride and opportunity now. The golden jubilee celebration of Mumbai was a reminder that the following fifty years can be even more revolutionary than the last fifty years.\n",

      "content_full": "\nWhen Afghanistan shocked Pakistan at the 2023 Cricket World Cup, when Ireland shocked England at the T20 World Cup in Melbourne, or when Kenya shocked the world by reaching the semi-finals of the ODI World Cup in 2003, the headlines read \u201cUPSET.\u201d The word has become the shorthand used in cricket to talk about results that would not have been anticipated. But when is it reasonable \u2013 or of significance \u2013 to understand such instances as upsets rather than continuance?\n\n\n\nIn cricket, several \u201cbig\u201d nations have taken historical dominance that has never been seen in football. Despite the high-level development of the game, and widespread access to understand how to make meaningful improvements and development in the game. The mindset that had developed and solidified with the belief that only England, Australia, or India could be the only sides that could ever consistently reach the peak of any major tournament dismissed victories from emerging sides as upsets.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, here we are in 2025, where Afghanistan, Ireland, and the Netherlands are now producing world-class players and infrastructure around these players. And the word \u201cupset\u201d seems irrelevant and unfair, even to these teams, because they do not see it as merely a win; they see it as the culmination of years of hard work and waiting.\n\n\n\nThe weight of language in sport\n\n\n\nIn many ways, words are important in cricket. By calling a victory an \u201cupset,\u201d we are subtly creating a narrative that, despite the achievements involved with the victory, is detrimental. The idea of an upset implies that the winning team stumbled into a fortunate outcome but not through their talent, skills, preparedness, or determination.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at Afghanistan. Since they have been in ODI status since 2009, they have built up a formidable talent pipeline, especially in spin bowling. They now have players who are the envy of the world\u2019s T20 leagues. Rashid Khan is just as recognisable as any star from cricket\u2019s traditional power. Yet when Afghanistan beat former champions, they were often portrayed in reports as a \u201cgiant-killing act\u201d rather than a result based on continuous developmental improvement in cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is also true for Ireland. Their beating Pakistan in 2007 was a genuine shock, sure, but few believed that at the time. But by 2011, when they chased down 329 to beat England in Bangalore, to still think of it as an \u201cupset\u201d seemed to ignore what we expected. Ireland had a well-established domestic pathway and had players like Kevin O\u2019Brien and Paul Stirling who could win matches. Even using \u201cupset\u201d nearly two decades on feels a little dismissive of how far they\u2019ve come.\n\n\n\nDouble standards in cricket\n\n\n\nCuriously, cricket seems more hesitant than other sports to accept \u201cthe underdog shock\u201d; for example, in football, Japan beating Germany at the 2022 FIFA World Cup was viewed as Japan\u2019s tactical maturity beating Europe and not just a good day.\n\n\n\nAlthough there is structural inequality in cricket that reinforces the language. The \u201cFull Member vs Associate\u201d divide within the ICC keeps emerging nations in a second tier, limiting their matches and exposure. So when a team like the Netherlands beats South Africa, it is called a David vs Goliath situation, while not recognizing that the Dutch players are professional cricketers who train and play with the same South Africans in county cricket and international leagues.\n\n\n\nGrowth demands recognition\n\n\n\nFor cricket to become a truly global sport, it must acknowledge wins by the emerging nations on their own merits. The rise of Afghanistan is not accidental; it is a product of talent, investment, and perseverance in a country at war. Ireland was not given Test status; they earned it. The Netherlands\u2019 World Cup victories in 2023 did not come off the back of \u201cluck,\u201d but hard work, disciplined bowling, and savvy batting.\n\n\n\nTo label the outcomes as \u201cupsets\u201d also disregards the decline, complacency, or tactical errors of traditional powers. Pakistan collapsing under scoreboard pressure, or South Africa losing against spin, becomes part of the story the same way a \u201csmaller\u201d team excelling under pressure is. Generally depicting one as shocked and the other as a fluke, while not inaccurately characterizing the contest, oversimplifies it.\n\n\n\nThis must change with the sport. Rather than having headlines that say \u201cShock Defeat,\u201d it could say \u201cAfghanistan Outclass Pakistan\u201d or \u201cIreland Too Strong for England.\u201d The story becomes about merit, not surprise. It is important to keep in mind that \u201cupstarts\u201d are frequently tomorrow\u2019s mainstream events. Sri Lanka used to be the Cinderella story in international cricket. Their 1996 World Cup victory was labeled an upset. Today, they are a nation of former champions. Sri Lanka was able to go from being an outsider to an insider; so why not Afghanistan, Ireland, or Nepal in the next 10 or 20 years?\n\n\n\nBeyond Semantics\n\n\n\nAt first glance, this might feel like a semantic debate. But the reality is that the word \u201cupset\u201d has structural implications. It influences the way fans think about teams, the way governing bodies organize schedules, and the way young players from those countries view their own possibilities.\n\n\n\nCricket is richer, more competitive, and more unpredictable when victories by so-called smaller teams are normalised rather than sensationalised. They should be celebrated as markers of progress, not treated as accidents in a sport still clinging to old hierarchies.\n\n\n\nThe next time Afghanistan, Ireland, or the Netherlands beat a cricketing powerhouse, perhaps it\u2019s time for journalists, commentators, and fans alike to retire the word upset. The game and its emerging nations deserve better.\n",

      "content_full": "\nBarcelona want to make history. The club has asked permission to play their La Liga match against Villarreal in Miami this December. If approved, it would be the first time a Spanish league game is staged outside Spain. But the decision doesn\u2019t rest with Bar\u00e7a or La Liga\u2014it now lies with UEFA and, later, FIFA.\n\n\n\nThe Miami Dream\n\n\n\nThe proposal, sent to UEFA in early August, asks for Villarreal vs Barcelona on December 20, 2025 to be played at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. This isn\u2019t Bar\u00e7a\u2019s first attempt; they\u2019ve tried twice before to bring La Liga to the U.S. But this time, they have the full backing of La Liga president Javier Tebas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept is straightforward: make the competition global, expand the brand, and access the emerging U.S. soccer market. In the case of Barcelona, it would be to get to the fans who might never get a chance to watch the club play in Europe. In the case of LaLiga, it shows that the league is capable of competing with the popularity of the Premier League in the global market. Not everyone agrees. Real Madrid has also lodged an official complaint with UEFA, citing that relocating the match to a foreign country would jeopardise the integrity of the competition.\n\n\n\nThe Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) resisted as well. Its president David Aganzo condemned the fact that the move was made without consulting the players, terming it as disrespect. Supporters will lose most according to fan groups in Europe, particularly Football Supporters Europe. Most season-ticket buyers cannot practically travel thousands of miles to see a game at home.\n\n\n\nWhat UEFA Will Decide\n\n\n\nThe case will be reviewed at UEFA\u2019s Executive Committee meeting in Tirana on September 11. The committee has a packed agenda, which also includes picking the host cities for the 2027 Champions League finals. But Barcelona\u2019s Miami request could be the most far-reaching decision.\n\n\n\nIf UEFA give the green light, FIFA must still sign off in October. Without FIFA\u2019s approval, the match cannot go ahead. Spain isn\u2019t alone in this debate. Italy\u2019s Serie A has submitted a similar request for Milan vs Como to be played in Perth, Australia, in February 2026. That proposal has far more support\u2014mainly because San Siro won\u2019t be available due to the Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\n\n\n\nThe contrast is telling: in Italy, clubs see the overseas match as a practical solution. In Spain, many see it as a money-driven gamble that could erode tradition.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters ?\n\n\n\nIf Villarreal vs Barcelona is staged in Miami, it will set a precedent not just for La Liga but for European football as a whole. UEFA will need to create rules: How often can league matches be played abroad? Which clubs get chosen? What limits should be in place to protect fans and the competition\u2019s fairness?\n\n\n\nFor Barcelona, the match could be a global showcase. For their critics, it could be a step too far in turning football into a business first and a sport second.\n\n\n\nSeptember 11: A Day of Decision\n\n\n\nUEFA\u2019s ruling will shape more than just one game. It will reveal how European football intends to balance tradition with globalization. For now, the fate of Villarreal vs Barcelona in Miami hangs in the balance\u2014caught between ambition, resistance, and the future of the sport itself.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe Champions League final is no stranger to drama, but this time the action is happening off the pitch. UEFA has confirmed that starting with the 2026 edition, the men\u2019s final will kick off at 6 p.m. Central European Time (5 p.m. GMT, noon ET)\u2014three hours earlier than its traditional late-night slot. The change, announced just before this season\u2019s draw in Monaco, has already sparked mixed emotions across the football world.\n\n\n\nWhy UEFA Made the Change\n\n\n\nFor years, the Champions League final has been staged at 9 p.m. in Europe. While that time favored prime-time television audiences, it often meant matches stretching close to midnight\u2014especially when extra time or penalties came into play. For families, children, and traveling fans, it wasn\u2019t always practical.\n\n\n\nUEFA president Aleksander \u010ceferin said the decision was about \u201cplacing the fans\u2019 experience at the heart of planning.\u201d The earlier kickoff, he argued, makes for a safer, smoother, and more enjoyable day out. Fans can use public transport without the stress of late-night travel, and host cities get the benefit of supporters lingering longer to celebrate afterward.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also the global audience to consider. By shifting the match into daylight hours in Europe, the final becomes more accessible for fans watching in Asia and the Americas, who have long complained about having to stay awake until the early hours.\n\n\n\nThe First Daylight Final\n\n\n\nThe new timing will be introduced at the 2026 Champions League final in Budapest\u2019s Pusk\u00e1s Arena on May 30. UEFA hopes the earlier slot will broaden the event\u2019s reach while also giving young fans a chance to experience the full spectacle without bedtime clashes.\n\n\n\nThe UEFA Champions League final will kick off at 18:00CET as of the 2025/26 season. The decision is designed to enhance the matchday experience and benefit fans, teams and host cities.\u2014 UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) August 28, 2025 \n\n\n\nUEFA\u2019s liaison with Football Supporters Europe, Ronan Evain, welcomed the move. He said: \u201cAn earlier kickoff makes day trips more feasible, reduces travel stress and allows fans to enjoy the occasion without worrying about late-night logistics.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn other words, this isn\u2019t just about television ratings\u2014it\u2019s about reimagining the final as a full-day festival.\n\n\n\nFans React: Excitement and Skepticism\n\n\n\nAs with any major change in football, supporters are split. Some welcomed the decision, calling it a \u201cperfect\u201d move that finally puts global fans first. One fan posted online: \u201cDon\u2019t have to wake up at 2 a.m. to watch the UCL.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut others see it differently. For traditionalists, the sight of lifting the trophy under floodlights is part of the Champions League\u2019s magic. \u201cSeeing a team lift the trophy in daylight will kill the vibe a little,\u201d one fan complained. Another questioned whether catering to overseas viewers undermines the fact that this is, at its core, a European competition.\n\n\n\nThe debate highlights football\u2019s modern balancing act\u2014keeping its historic atmosphere while appealing to a global audience worth billions.\n\n\n\nBroader Implications\n\n\n\nUEFA\u2019s shift is about more than just convenience. It\u2019s also about economics and strategy. By staging the final earlier, UEFA hopes to:\n\n\n\n\nBoost TV ratings worldwide by hitting prime-time slots in Asia and better daytime hours in the Americas.\n\n\n\nImprove fan safety with easier transport and shorter nights.\n\n\n\nIncrease revenue opportunities for host cities as supporters spend more time in restaurants, bars, and public fan zones.\n\n\n\nEngage younger viewers, who are increasingly consuming football through digital platforms rather than staying up for late-night broadcasts.\n\n\n\n\nIn short, this is football adapting to a new media landscape.\n\n\n\nItalian Clubs Still Chasing Glory\n\n\n\nIt was announced on the same day as the 2025-26 Champions League draw, as Napoli, Inter, Atalanta, and Juventus are the representatives of Serie A this season. The Italian clubs have also reached four finals over the past six years, with two wins (Juventus 2015, 2017) and two losses (Inter 2023, 2025) but never won the trophy.\n\n\n\nThe most recent Italian victory was in 2010, when Jose Mourinho-led Inter defeated Bayern Munich in Madrid. In the case of Serie A, the earlier start does not alter the challenge: the need to eliminate a 16-year-long drought.\n\n\n\nA Shift in Tradition\n\n\n\nTo purists, the 9 p.m. kickoff was part of the identity of the Champions League an appointment at the end of an already long Saturday when the whole world gazed at one of the largest sporting events in the world. To take it to daylight is like a break with convention.\n\n\n\nBut football is ever changing. The format of the tournament has evolved in the 2024-25 season, and so does its marquee event. The success of the gamble could come with the success of the Budapest 2026, where the champions league final will be played in the early evening sun.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Progress or Problem?\n\n\n\nThe move of hosting the champions league final in the daytime is a radical move by UEFA. It is about making the game more inclusive, safer and more global- but it also jeopardises some of the mystique that made the final feel more like a special night out.\n\n\n\nAt least temporarily, the largest stage of football is being re-laid. On May 30, 2026, the world will not only see which team will be lifting the trophy but also whether daylight will make the most celebrated football match in Europe more magical or not.\n",

      "content_full": "\nAfghanistan will head into the 2025 Asia Cup, taking place in the United Arab Emirates, at full strength, with a renewed sense of belief they can rattle the established order in world cricket again. Reaching the T20 World Cup semi-finals last year against sides such as New Zealand and Australia has left Rashid Khan\u2019s men eager to continue building momentum going into the T20 World Cup in 2026.\n\n\n\nSpin-heavy arsenal\n\n\n\nThe Asia Cup will be perfect preparation, and the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has taken no punches by naming a 17-member squad that achieves balance, depth, and variety. The most noticeable aspect of the squad is the spin department. Rashid will have one of the toughest spin bowling forces in the tournament with several weaponry opponents will have to face: Noor Ahmad, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Mohammad Nabi, and teenage wonder Allah Mohammad Ghazanfar.\n\n\n\nAll four will back their captain in conditions that should suit slow bowling, making Afghanistan arguably the most dangerous spin side in Asia. The selection of Ghazanfar is noteworthy; at only 19, he already has two 5-fers in ODIs, including a player-of-the-match six-for against Bangladesh in Sharjah. His inclusion adds an element of mystery to a side that already has respect globally in this department.\n\n\n\nExperienced core with fresh energy\n\n\n\nSpin is Afghanistan\u2018s strength, but they have more than one dimension. The batting unit is a good blend of experienced players and exciting youth. Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran should be the likely opening partnership and provide power with stability at the top of the order. Darwish Rasooli and Sediqullah Atal are more options at the top and middle orders. Mohammad Ishaq has added competition in the wicketkeeping area.\n\n\n\nThe even older Mohammad Nabi continues to be the glue in the middle, along with all-rounders Karim Janat, Gulbadin Naib, and Azmatullah Omarzai, and has the flexibility that Afghanistan can be proud of when looking at balance.\n\n\n\nThe pace bowling stocks have been further bolstered by the return of Naveen-ul-Haq, who hasn\u2019t played for Afghanistan in 2023, since retiring from ODIs this year. With Naveen back, alongside Fazalhaq Farooqi and Farid Ahmad Malik in the seam department, and Omarzai and Naib as back-up all-rounders, Afghanistan isn\u2019t getting too spin-heavy, as they can play with pace, even if spin remains their preferred approach.\n\n\n\nNot enough preparation\n\n\n\nThe ramp-up for the Asia Cup has not been ideal. Afghanistan has only played three T20Is in the last twelve months, all against Zimbabwe in Harare last December. And hasn\u2019t played in any format since the Champions Trophy earlier in 2025. The triangular T20I series in Sharjah against the UAE and Pakistan, which starts this week, will be Afghanistan\u2019s first international cricket of 2025.\n\n\n\nThis lack of match practice is worrying, especially against India and Sri Lanka, who have been playing more cricket than them. However, Afghanistan has also had domestic competitions, and many of its players have signed contracts. It means that while they have not had international cricket, the last month or so has involved a lot of cricket for players like Nabi, Omarzai, Ishaq, and Farooqi, who made headlines in the tournament.\n\n\n\nSWOT analysis in narrative\n\n\n\nThe strengths of this Afghanistan side are obvious and remarkable. They probably have the best spin attack in the tournament, one that not only controls the middle overs but regularly takes wickets as well. For many sides, this is difficult to achieve in T20 cricket. They have variation and strike power in their bowling attack; Rashid and Mujeeb can change matches by themselves. The experience of Nabi and the fortitude of Gurbaz and Ibrahim create a resolve that Afghanistan has often lacked in the past.\n\n\n\nThe area of most concern is in the batting order and especially the middle overs, with Afghanistan sometimes struggling to accelerate. Strike rate concerns among middle-order batters could expose them when pressured in chases or on flat pitches in the UAE. There could also be a reliance on conditions that suit spin, leaving them vulnerable. With the potential of testing the bowling balance if the wickets in Abu Dhabi were to play truer and favour seam. Coming into the competition without having played a lot of international cricket could leave them out of sync.\n\n\n\nBut opportunity is abundant. The Asia Cup is an opportunity to consolidate their growing reputation as Asia\u2019s second-best T20 side (behind India). It also allows Rashid Khan to re-establish himself as a global captain after mixed results in franchise cricket. Furthermore, with Ghazanfar being selected, the prospect of a further Afghan spin prodigy announcing himself on the world stage is something to savour alongside Rashid, Mujeeb, and Noor. Lastly, it will be an excellent preparation phase ahead of the T20 World Cup next year, as Afghanistan try to top their semi-final run in 2024.\n\n\n\nThe threats can\u2019t be overlooked. Injuries to key players, Rashid struggling with back problems and Naveen\u2019s workload management concerns can derail Afghanistan\u2019s campaign. Opponents such as India and Sri Lanka have deeper batting line-ups that can negate Afghanistan\u2019s bowling strengths. There is also the threat of slipping against lower-ranked opponents: their first match against Hong Kong in Abu Dhabi on September 9 is a potential banana skin.\n\n\n\nSquad: Rashid Khan (C), Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Naveen Ul Haq, Fazal Haq Farooqi, Darwish Rasooli, Sediqullah Atal, Azmatullah Omarzai, Karim Janat, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Sharafuddin Ashraf, Mohammad Ishaq, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, AM Ghazanfar, Noor Ahmed, and Fariq Ahmed. \u00a0\n",

      "content_full": "\n\u201cHave you seen this one?\u201d I asked a colleague earlier today. \u201cChelsea and Manchester United are edging closer to a deal for Alejandro Garnacho. It\u2019s not quite wrapped up yet, but reports suggest there\u2019s already a broad agreement in place\u2014in the region of \u00a350 million, including add-ons.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reply was immediate: \u201cFifty million for a player United don\u2019t even want? That\u2019s something.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd that is the point. Garnacho, who had once been regarded as one of United\u2019s most promising young players, has been excluded by manager Ruben Amorim. The 21-year-old winger did not participate in preseason tours in both ways, in the United States and Europe, and did not play in the first two rounds of the Premier League with United this season.\n\n\n\nThis is a major decline in the ranks of Old Trafford following 198 senior career matches and 49 goals to the name of a player with so much attained.\n\n\n\nWhy Garnacho Wants Chelsea\n\n\n\nThe most telling part of this story is Garnacho\u2019s determination to join Chelsea over other suitors. Bayern Munich expressed serious interest, while lucrative offers came in from Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Napoli also monitored the situation earlier in the summer. Yet Garnacho has made it clear that he only wants a move to Stamford Bridge.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udd35 Alejandro Garnacho and Chelsea, deal remains very advanced with all parties expected it to happen.Garnacho has rejected new approach from Saudi Pro League in last 48h, he only wants Chelsea as destination. pic.twitter.com/mOq2HoqpZ6\u2014 Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) August 26, 2025 \n\n\n\nThat clarity of purpose matters in modern transfers. Far too often, players allow themselves to be swayed by money or agents\u2019 interests, but Garnacho has communicated to friends and family that his decision is already made. He wants London, and he wants to work under Enzo Maresca. For Chelsea fans, that\u2019s an encouraging sign. It shows a young player motivated not by salary, but by opportunity and fit.\n\n\n\nIt also fits Chelsea\u2019s new recruitment model. Under Maresca, they are looking for technically gifted, attack-minded players who can adapt to fluid systems. Garnacho, despite his struggles at United, ticks those boxes. His pace, directness, and versatility could make him an ideal project for a manager who values tactical intelligence and flexibility.\n\n\n\nUnited\u2019s Hardline Stance\n\n\n\nManchester United, however, is not prepared to let him go cheaply. Their asking price remains firm at \u00a350m. To put that into perspective, they point toward recent sales of similarly profiled players: Noni Madueke moved to Arsenal for \u00a348m, and Anthony Elanga went to Newcastle for \u00a352m. United argue Garnacho belongs in the same bracket, if not higher, given his international caps for Argentina.\n\n\n\nFrom United\u2019s perspective, this stance makes sense. Letting go of a 21-year-old winger with close to 200 appearances for a cut-price fee could be seen as poor business, regardless of his current status under Amorim. By setting the bar high, United protects their valuation of young talent while avoiding accusations of selling to a Premier League rival on the cheap.\n\n\n\nChelsea, meanwhile, began negotiations closer to \u00a335m, hoping United\u2019s urgency to trim their squad would bring flexibility. But Amorim\u2019s decision to freeze Garnacho out has not softened United\u2019s negotiating position. If anything, it has made them more determined to extract maximum value. The result is a transfer poker game\u2014Chelsea know Garnacho wants them, and United know Chelsea need reinforcements out wide.\n\n\n\nWhat Garnacho Brings to the Blues\n\n\n\nDespite his exile from United\u2019s squad, Garnacho brings plenty to the table. At just 21, he has amassed 198 career appearances across multiple competitions\u2014Premier League, Europa League, Champions League, and domestic cups. His return of 49 goals and 32 assists shows productivity, even when he is not always a starter.\n\n\n\nAlejandro Garnacho is reportedly CONVINCED that he will be a Chelsea player by the end of the transfer window \ud83e\udd14\u270d\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/EoVu59w3XH\u2014 LiveScore (@livescore) August 26, 2025 \n\n\n\nTechnically, he is most dangerous as a left winger, where he can cut inside on his stronger right foot, but he has also been deployed on the right and in attacking midfield. That versatility will appeal to Chelsea, who often rotate their frontline and need depth across several positions.\n\n\n\nAt the international level, Garnacho has represented Argentina eight times since his debut in 2023. While he has yet to score for the national team, his inclusion shows the regard in which he is held by Lionel Scaloni and his coaching staff. With the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, the winger will be eager to cement a role in Argentina\u2019s plans\u2014another motivating factor behind securing regular football at the club level.\n\n\n\nFor Chelsea, this is a player with both experience and potential. Unlike a raw academy graduate, Garnacho has already faced the pressures of top-level football at Old Trafford. But unlike an established veteran, his ceiling remains high. If Maresca can unlock his talent, the \u00a350m fee may soon look like smart business.\n\n\n\nA Gamble or a Bargain?\n\n\n\nAnd so we come to the bigger question: is this a gamble or a bargain in disguise?\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, Garnacho has been frozen out by Amorim and clearly deemed surplus at United. Paying \u00a350m for a player who cannot get into their squad carries obvious risks. Chelsea supporters have seen similar moves backfire before, with talented but inconsistent signings struggling to adapt under the spotlight.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Garnacho has attributes that money cannot easily buy\u2014pace, flair, and a hunger to prove people wrong. Players at 21 who have close to 200 senior games under their belt are rare. If he arrives at Stamford Bridge with the right mentality, he could transform Chelsea\u2019s attacking options and finally live up to the hype that once surrounded him at United.\n\n\n\nAs my colleague summed it up when we finished debating the move, \u201cFifty million for a kid who can\u2019t get into United\u2019s squad? Football never changes.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps not. But football also has a habit of giving players second chances. If Garnacho takes his at Chelsea, this transfer could be remembered as one of the most intriguing moves of the 2025 window.\n",

      "content_full": "\nEver since the India squad for the Asia Cup was announced on August 19, there has been one question on everyone\u2019s mind: Why couldn\u2019t Shreyas Iyer make it to the team despite his stellar IPL season and T20 stats? Fans, commentators, and even former greats have expressed disapproval over Iyer\u2019s absence, reigniting the long-running discussion about how India strikes a balance between \u201cform, role, and combinations\u201d when choosing white-ball players.\n\n\n\nRecent T20 Stats of Shreyas Iyer:\n\n\n\nAs captain of the Punjab Kings in the 2025 Indian Premier League, Iyer scored 604 runs at an average of 50.33 and a blistering strike rate of 175.07 in 17 innings, with six fifties, the best up to 97 not out. This is the sort of middle-order power and pace that any T20 team can rely on presently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShreyas Iyer has been in form in the domestic T20 tournament. In 9 games of the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he smashed 345 runs at an average of almost 49.29, with a strike rate of 188.52, and topped out with a score of 130. He was a top scorer in the whole thing.\n\n\n\nWhat did the experts say about Iyer\u2019s selection?\n\n\n\nHaving been a member of the Champions Trophy squad that won the Cup this year, Shreyas Iyer is a very promising young lad. He played under KKR last year when it won the IPL 2024; this year, Iyer played in the Punjab Kings till the final of the IPL 2025. He could not find place in the Asia Cup 2025 team despite his good show in T20 format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this matter, BCCI chief selector\u00a0Ajit Agarkar\u00a0said, \u201d With regards to Shreyas, not his fault, nor is it ours. It\u2019s just that you can pick 15, and at the moment you\u2019ll have to wait for his chance,\u201d. Former CSK player Subramaniam Badrinath said in his YouTube channel that \u201cHe definitely deserved to get selected. Ajit Agarkar said he was unlucky, but that\u2019s just a convenient route. Iyer has produced excellent numbers over the last two years and done brilliantly as a captain as well. Instead, they picked\u00a0Shivam Dube\u00a0and\u00a0Rinku Singh\u00a0for the No. 5 position. Last year, both have done virtually nothing, with poor numbers,\u201d. \n\n\n\nSubramaniam Badrinath\u2019s YouTube video on this matter\n\n\n\nThe Middle Order Debate:\n\n\n\nIndia seems to be increasing their reliance on left-right diversity, multi-utility bowlers, and ultra-high powerplay pace in the hopes that their squad will be more suited to the UAE\u2019s conditions and knockout unpredictability. A batsman like Iyer, who often bats at No. 3 or 4, would be considered an extra in India\u2019s current team plan if the selectors favour a left-hander, a batsman who can bowl a few overs, or a batter who can hit huge shots right away in the closing overs.\n\n\n\nThis is not to conclude that Shreyas Iyer is a mere steady player, as he exhibited during his recent performance. He has a strike rate of more than 175 in the 2025 Indian Premier League and over 188 in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. These figures show that he is extremely fast at scoring goals as well as sustaining pressure and learn to adjust to the requirements of the game.\n\n\n\nIndia and Iyer\u2019s Situation:\n\n\n\nIncredible depth is an advantage for India; one might argue against a 600-run IPL season, given the presence of other top choices. Role consistency is a risk; you want a batsman who can take pressure and stay on the pitch if early wickets fall or spin takes control of the middle overs. In 2025, Iyer has frequently done just that, but still couldn\u2019t make it to the Asia Cup 2025 squad.\n\n\n\nAlthough it is difficult, Shreyas Iyer\u2019s path back to the team is clear. In T20 cricket, he will have to keep on hitting big scores and make it difficult for the selectors to ignore him. His 2025 performance of 604 in the IPL runs at a strike rate of 175, and his Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy performances are self-explanatory. His exclusion will likely be more heavily questioned if India has trouble in the middle order during the Asia Cup. Many fans and experts are still shocked that one of the year\u2019s most productive T20 batsmen isn\u2019t in the squad, even though the selectors are sticking to their explanation of \u201cteam combinations\u201d for the time being.\n",

Yet, when examining the regional distribution of players across formats, players from Maharashtra and Delhi still dominate. For instance, 74% of Indian batsmen and 82% of bowlers come from eight key states, including Tamil Nadu, but southern representation remains proportionally lower.\n\n\n\nSocietal & Cultural Barriers\n\n\n\nSouth Indian society often emphasizes academics and stable employment. As ESPNcricinfo observed, many southern families historically prioritize education over sports, seeing professional cricket as risky without a backup career. Uniform academic success and cautious career planning tend to pull good talent into other fields.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, even within states like Tamil Nadu, structural biases sometimes meant that early state-level selections favored certain communities\u2014though that\u2019s gradually changing. Community outreach in recent years has unlocked talents from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.\n\n\n\nSystemic & Structural Challenges\n\n\n\nCritics point to structural biases within selection systems:\n\n\n\n\nZonal affiliations: Selectors were previously chosen based on zones, leading to alleged favoritism. Efforts to reduce this bias have seen mixed results.\n\n\n\nIPL-elevated selection: Performance in the IPL often garners more attention than consistent domestic (Ranji Trophy) performances\u2014a system that may sideline players not spotlighted in the IPL.\n\n\n\n\nThese factors suggest that broader representation remains a work in progress\u2014not merely an issue of talent, but of access and visibility.\n\n\n\nVoices from the Ground\n\n\n\nFans and former cricketers have noticed the gap:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn general, players from small towns and South India aren\u2019t getting a lot of chances.\u201d\u201cWhy do players from Tamil Nadu always have to perform double time to get in?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nShared via Reddit discussions referencing multiple voices, including Badrinath and fans echoing similar concerns.\n\n\n\nBroader Societal Patterns\n\n\n\nThere are also deeper socio-economic angles at play. Academic and urban-centric requirements for corporate patronage in sports indirectly favor northern and metropolitan players. Scholars argue these norms have slowed broader inclusion, especially for marginalized communities and states.\n\n\n\nSigns of Positive Change\n\n\n\nNot all is stagnant. Karnataka was once the backbone of Indian cricket, producing multiple Test legends. Today, the Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) and the National Cricket Academy (NCA) aim to expand scouting efforts beyond elite urban centers\u2014creating pathways for talent across regions.\n\n\n\nInclusive grassroots initiatives and expanded interstate competitions are gradually leveling the field, offering hope for more balanced national representation.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nThe South Indian underrepresentation in the Indian cricket team isn\u2019t due to lack of talent\u2014it\u2019s shaped by historical, cultural, and structural factors. While IPL franchises and state bodies are slowly bridging gaps, the BCCI must continue promoting meritocracy through transparent selection, grassroots investment, and institutional reforms. That way, more deserving talent from southern India can earn their deserved place at the national level.\n",

But beneath the surface, caste remains an unvoiced actor\u2014most visible at grassroots and early-stage selection, affecting who makes it to state and national teams.\n\n\n\nHistory Speaks: Direct and Indirect Exclusion\n\n\n\nCaste bias in Indian cricket isn\u2019t a recent accusation\u2014it\u2019s rooted in the sport\u2019s early history. Palwankar Baloo, one of India\u2019s first Dalit cricketers, faced overt discrimination. He was served tea outside the pavilion and denied captaincy despite being one of the best bowlers of his time. His brother Vithal also faced similar treatment, only rising to captain the Hindus team after public protest.\n\n\n\nDespite social progress, representation remains dismal: out of over 500 cricketers in Tests and ODIs, only around five have been from Scheduled Castes\u2014roughly 1%, even though SCs constitute about 20% of India\u2019s population.\n\n\n\nCricket historian Ramachandra Guha and researchers Shubham Jain and Gaurav Bhawnani documented that between the 1950s and 1980s, nearly half of India\u2019s Test cricketers hailed from six cities\u2014often reinforcing upper-caste dominance.\n\n\n\nOfficial Denials vs. Underlying Biases\n\n\n\nFormer selector and India captain Ajit Wadekar famously stated, \u201cI have never seen any discrimination in the selection of players for the Indian team. The players who performed were selected.\u201d Yet critics point to structural issues beyond overt bias: upper-caste dominance in BCCI leadership and selection roles that filters down through every tier. \n\n\n\nThe journalist Chetan Ahimsa called out this imbalance, arguing that cricket could be stronger and more inclusive if it tapped talent from underprivileged castes. And while BCCI considered a caste-based selection policy in 2008\u2014proposing that 7 of the 15 squad members come from SC/ST/OBC communities\u2014it never materialized.\n\n\n\nGrassroots Gatekeeping\n\n\n\nBias shows strongest in district and Ranji Trophy selections. In states like Tamil Nadu, players from non-Brahmin communities recount systemic privilege: \u201cOnly upper-caste players get access to facilities and selection,\u201d said one club cricketer about being overlooked despite captaining his city team. Coaches, he claimed, would often check for a \u201csacred thread\u201d before endorsing a player.\n\n\n\nWhile local cricket officials often insist selection is merit-based, community insiders describe a more complex picture\u2014club politics, insider networks, and unspoken preferences remain common filters.\n\n\n\nStructural Intervention or Freedom?\n\n\n\nSome argue against quotas, saying they could undermine merit and morale in sports. As one commentary put it, cricket should reward form and ability\u2014not be recast as a social instrument.\n\n\n\nBut observers point out the systemic barriers that block marginalized players from entry. As one Redditor noted:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCricket is expensive. SC/ST youth often lack economic means, relegate cricket to a luxury\u2026 and thus, representation remains low.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOutlook\u2019s Pragya Singh calls for a shift from complaining to reform\u2014through transparent selection, improved grassroots access, and targeted talent development from disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\nEncouraging Signs\u2014but Work Remains\n\n\n\nWhile caste-centric exclusion isn\u2019t overt, cricket\u2019s governing structures remain rooted in privilege. The BCCI\u2019s Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) has been a bright spot: launched in 2002 to scout talent beyond major cities and break urban-centric bias, it helped discover players like MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina.\n\n\n\nBut TRDW systems have waned, and caste is absent from current diversity metrics\u2014leaving us without data to gauge real progress.\n\n\n\nWhat Needs to Change\n\n\n\n\nTransparent mechanisms: Publish selection criteria and performance data at state levels.\n\n\n\nProactive scouting: Reignite efforts like TRDW focusing on marginalized regions.\n\n\n\nMentorship programs: Provide financial backing and coaching to talent overlooked due to caste or class.\n\n\n\nLeadership reform: Ensure representation from backward communities in cricket administration.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nIndian cricket assumes meritocracy, yet legacy and privilege still linger. While overt casteism may be rare, systemic barriers persist\u2014blocking equally talented players from marginalized groups. History shows\u2014from Baloo to Kambli to Bedrock-era Brahmins\u2014the face of Indian cricket has often been narrow.\n\n\n\nIf cricket wants to truly reflect India\u2019s diversity, it must first confront deep-rooted social biases\u2014anchoring change in transparency, access, and relentless meritocracy.\n",

Yet, the jersey that every player wears with honor has carried a strange shadow over the years. Time and again, the brands bold enough to place their name on Team India\u2019s chest have stumbled whether through financial collapse, regulatory hurdles, or strategic retreats. From Sahara\u2019s empire crumbling under regulatory heat to Byju\u2019s spectacular fall from unicorn glory, and now Dream11\u2019s sudden exit amid new gaming laws, the story has unfolded like an unshakable pattern. Many call it coincidence. Others call it destiny. But for fans, it feels like a never-ending curse tied to Indian cricket\u2019s Lead sponsors.\n\n\n\nThe Pattern We Don\u2019t Want to See\n\n\n\nIndian cricket is the heartbeat of a billion people. Yet, the brands that dare to sit on that chest front and center on the Team India jersey seem to falter, one after another. From Sahara to Dream11, the story reads like a warning: unmatched visibility, dizzying costs, soaring expectations\u2026 and then the slide. Is it coincidence? Pressure? Policy shocks? Whatever we call it, the pattern is undeniable. \n\n\n\nBefore the Storm: Wills (1993-2002)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe jersey era began with ITC\u2019s Wills in the 90s. It was a different country then tobacco branding still legal in sport, TV just finding scale, cricket becoming religion. When regulations tightened and the market moved on, a new age and a new kind of corporate ambition stepped in. \n\n\n\nSahara (2002-2013): Pride, Power\u2026 and a Fall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more than a decade, Sahara wasn\u2019t just a sponsor; it felt like part of the team. The logo held through heartbreak (2003) and healing (2011). But beyond the boundary, regulatory heat scorched the group. After raising roughly \u20b924,000 crore from ~3 crore investors, Sahara faced SEBI action, culminating in founder Subrata Roy\u2019s arrest in 2014. The sponsor that stood tallest eventually staggered under its own weight.\n\n\n\nStar India (2014-2017): The Broadcast Behemoth Takes the Front\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStar India moved from behind the camera to the jersey front, a power move that unified content and iconography. It was smart, sleek, and short. The deal ended quietly no scandal, no spectacle but in hindsight, it feels like the silent breath before the storm returned. \n\n\n\nOppo (2017-2019): Big Cheque, Brief Stay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Oppo landed the jersey rights in March 2017, the number did the talking: \u20b91,079 crore (~$156 million) for five years one of the largest jersey deals in cricket. But within two years, reality bit. Costs ballooned. Strategy shifted. Oppo handed the contract over to a hungry edtech unicorn, Byju\u2019s, at the same financial terms for the remaining period (till March 2022). \n\n\n\nByju\u2019s (2019-2023): Rocket Ship to Freefall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a moment, it felt perfect: India\u2019s hottest edtech on India\u2019s hottest jersey. In June 2022, Byju\u2019s even extended to the end of 2023 (reports pegged it near $55 million).  Then the music stopped. Revenues slowed post-pandemic, audits turned messy, and dues piled up. The BCCI moved to recover unpaid sponsorship fees (~\u20b9158 crore); insolvency proceedings flickered; eventually, a settlement was reached in July 2024 after months of bruising headlines and a collapse in valuation (from $22B in 2022 to < $3B in 2023). \n\n\n\nDream11 (2023-2025): Joy, Bill, Exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2023: Dream11 steps in as lead jersey sponsor, reportedly \u20b9358 crore over three years, with per-match fees of ~\u20b93 crore (home) and ~\u20b91 crore (away).  Stadium LEDs glow, TV stings fly, fantasy lineups fill. And then policy strikes. In August 2025, after India passed a sweeping Online Gaming Bill, Dream11 pulled out ahead of the Asia Cup.  Overnight, the jersey risked going logo-less, with BCCI promising to follow the law to the letter. \n\n\n\nSource: IndiaToday\n\n\n\nThe Money, The Math, The Mood\n\n\n\n\nVisibility: Team India delivers unmatched media weight weeks of live cricket, relentless clips, and a diaspora audience.\n\n\n\nCost Curve: The price of that attention is brutal. From Oppo\u2019s \u20b91,079 crore headline deal to Dream11\u2019s \u20b9358 crore package, the bar keeps climbing.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Whiplash: What markets give, policy can take fast. Edtech booms fade. Online gaming faces new rules. \n\n\n\n\nAnd through it all, the team plays. Shubman\u2019s straight drive doesn\u2019t check stock prices mid-air. Bumrah\u2019s yorker does not ask about quarterly losses. But the logo on their chest carries the invisible weight of boardrooms, regulations, and repayments.

India\u2019s new Online Gaming Bill is that brake. It draws a bright line between \u201cplay\u201d and \u201cpay,\u201d backing e-sports while banning real-money gaming. Here\u2019s what that really means for companies, for creators, and for the millions who game every day.\n\n\n\nWhat the Bill Does In Plain Words\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParliament has passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025, which bans money-based online games while creating a national framework to promote and regulate e-sports, educational, and social (non-monetary) games. It also proposes a central authority for oversight and rule-making. The Bill awaits presidential assent at the time of writing.\n\n\n\nSources: PIB explainer, PRS: Bill text (PDF), Reuters, TechCrunch, Al Jazeera\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Banned vs. Backed\n\n\n\n\nBanned: Offering, advertising, or facilitating online real-money games (RMG) i.e., games where users stake money for monetary returns. Several leading platforms halted money gaming within hours: Dream11 (RMG features), MPL, Zupee, and others have begun winding down money-based divisions. Sources: Reuters, TechCrunch, TOI, TOI  Zupee update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBacked: E-sports, non-monetary social games, and educational games under a formal regulatory and developmental framework. This builds on India\u2019s official recognition of e-sports in December 2022 and the extension of cash-incentive schemes to e-sports medalists and coaches in 2025. Sources: Government recognition of e-sports (PIB), Drishti IAS note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Now? The Backdrop: Tax, Harm, and Growth\n\n\n\nFor two years, the sector has lived with whiplash: 28% GST on deposits for online skill gaming (from October 2023), retrospective tax demands, and court challenges. The new law goes further eliminating money gaming altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: EY on 28% GST impact, EY report (PDF), MeitY IT Rules 2023 (PDF)\n\n\n\nGovernment voices have framed the move as a public-interest necessity, citing financial harm and addiction concerns. Reportage this week referenced data that Indians lose ~\u20b920,000 crore annually on RMG platforms, with ~450\u2013500 million gamers in the country.\n\n\n\nSources: Economic Times report, TOI data brief, FICCI-EY gamer base 2024\n\n\n\nAt the same time, GST collections from online gaming soared 412% in Oct 2023 Mar 2024 a sign of the industry\u2019s fiscal weight even before the ban.\n\n\n\nSource: ORF analysis\n\n\n\nThe Shockwave: What Changes on the Ground\n\n\n\nCompanies: Within a day of the vote, RMG features went dark on multiple apps. Public markets reacted; coverage notes pressure on gaming-linked equities and urgent legal reviews by firms.\n\n\n\nSources: Reuters, Reuters ban passed\n\n\n\nCreators and pros: Streamers and tournament organizers tied to fantasy/RMG must pivot to e-sports and free-to-play formats. For salaried staff in RMG divisions, near-term layoffs and team closures are real risks already being reported.\n\n\n\n\nCreators and Streamers with Online Money Gaming promotions\n\n\n\n\nSources: TechCrunch, TOI-shutdowns\n\n\n\nPlayers: Money-gaming wallets, deposits, and withdrawals will come under strict scrutiny and blocks via payment rails and app platforms. Non-monetary games and e-sports events should continue and, in theory, grow under the new framework.\n\n\n\nSources: PIB explainer, Al Jazeera\n\n\n\nThe Case For the Ban (Pros)\n\n\n\n1) Consumer protection first. The \u20b920,000 crore annual loss figure is staggering, and addiction-linked harms are not abstract for families who\u2019ve watched savings slip into \u201cone more game.\u201d Regulators argue that the social cost justified a decisive reset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Economic Times, TOI\n\n\n\n2) Clarity over chaos. The previous regime IT Rules amendments, self-regulatory bodies, state-level bans, and 28% GST created confusion and litigation. A single national law provides bright-line rules (even if harsh) and a clear runway for e-sports.\n\n\n\nSources: MeitY IT Rules (PDF), Cyril Amarchand analysis\n\n\n\n3) Serious backing for e-sports. India didn\u2019t just say \u201cno\u201d to RMG; it also said a bigger \u201cyes\u201d to e-sports recognized since 2022 and now prioritized with policy, funding signals, and medalist rewards. That\u2019s oxygen for teams, event IP, and talent pipelines.\n\n\n\nSources: PIB recognition & incentives\n\n\n\nThe Case Against the Ban (Cons)\n\n\n\n1) Jobs, startups, and capital at risk. The online gaming industry was on track for 250,000 jobs by 2025, with strong venture backing. A blanket ban on RMG could erase thousands of roles, freeze FDI, and shrink a sector that had grown at ~28% CAGR to \u20b916,428 crore in FY23.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: EY \u201cNew Frontiers\u201d, Commentary on the Bill, Investment impact write-up\n\n\n\n2) Enforcement isn\u2019t easy. Experts warn that blocking offshore apps, payment workarounds, and black-market skins/betting is a technical and legal marathon. Without robust, coordinated enforcement, users may migrate to riskier, unregulated avenues.\n\n\n\nSource: Indian Express explainer\n\n\n\n3) The \u201cskill vs chance\u201d gray zone. India\u2019s jurisprudence has long separated games of skill (e.g., poker, rummy, fantasy) from gambling. Critics argue that a blanket prohibition ignores this nuance and punishes compliant operators along with bad actors.\n\n\n\nSources: EY taxation brief, ET Commentary\n\n\n\nThe Scale of What\u2019s at Stake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s gamer base is ~488 million (2024) a cultural force bigger than most sports leagues combined. The broader gaming market was ~US$4.3B in 2024 and projected to US$15.2B by 2033 growth that now must come from e-sports, casual, and creator-led ecosystems instead of RMG.\n\n\n\nSources: FICCI-EY 2025 snapshot, IMARC market outlook\n\n\n\nFor E-Sports: A Door Opens But Walk Through It\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the moment for Indian e-sports to get serious about grassroots leagues, scholastic programs, athlete welfare, anti-doping & integrity codes, and broadcast-ready events. With state support and a national authority inbound, organizers can push for venues, visas, and visibility that match cricket and kabaddi\u2019s playbooks. The emotional center here is simple: treat players like athletes and fans like community, not just \u201cusers.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor Money-Gaming Startups: Pivot, Partner, or Pause\n\n\n\n\nPivot to non-monetary products (skill without stakes), ad-supported formats, and brand-backed e-sports IP.\n\n\n\nPartner with publishers, sports leagues, and streamers to build safe, high-integrity competitions.\n\n\n\nPause contested features; ensure wallet settlements, KYC, and data deletion comply with the new law and IT rules. References for compliance context: MeitY IT Rules 2023 (PDF), PRS Bill text\n\n\n\n\nThe Emotion Beneath the Headlines\n\n\n\nFor families burnt by losses, this law feels like relief. For founders who built teams, tech, and trust under shifting goalposts, it feels like whiplash. For athletes who\u2019ve spent years convincing the world that e-sports is sport, it feels like recognition finally. All three truths can exist at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia just made a values choice: play is welcome; wagering is not. If we pair that principle with smart enforcement and serious investment in e-sports, we can protect people without dimming the creative fire that made Indian gaming what it is.\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nIndia Joins Central Asia\u2019s Football Festival: CAFA Nations Cup 2025 Preview\n\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n",

Yet, the silence is deafening.\n\n\n\nSource: IndiaTimes\n\n\n\nNumbers That Tell a Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf cricket is a game of numbers, then Pujara\u2019s are a saga. They don\u2019t scream; they whisper tales of grit.\n\n\n\nFormatMatchesRunsAverage100s50sHighest ScoreTest Cricket1037,19543.601935206One Day Internationals55110.200027First-Class Cricket260+21,30151.826690+352\n\n\n\nSource: Times of India, Reuters\n\n\n\nMost will look at his ODI record and shrug. But that was never his stage. His stage was Test cricket where time slowed down, where patience mattered more than power, and where his value wasn\u2019t in the runs alone, but in the minutes, hours, and even days he spent saving India.\n\n\n\nThe Knocks That Defined Him\n\n\n\nWhat makes a batsman unforgettable? For Pujara, it wasn\u2019t sixes into the stands. It was the way he carried India on his shoulders when others had fallen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ranchi, 2017, he batted as if time itself was under his command 202 runs from 525 balls against Australia. That innings didn\u2019t just tire the bowlers; it drained the fight out of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Adelaide, 2018, he played the lone warrior\u2019s role. His 123 and 71 in two innings set the tone for India\u2019s first-ever Test series win in Australia. Without those knocks, history might have looked very different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut nothing will ever overshadow the Gabba Test, January 2021. On that final day, India needed courage more than flair. Pujara stood like a wall absorbing bouncers on his body, blows on his arms, balls smashing into his ribs. He scored just 56, but those runs were written in blood and bruises. That day, he didn\u2019t just defend India\u2019s wicket; he defended India\u2019s pride.\n\n\n\nSource: Hindustan Times\n\n\n\nThe Man Beneath the Helmet\n\n\n\nCheteshwar Pujara was unlike most modern cricketers. No extravagant celebrations, no sledging, no drama. Just calm eyes under a helmet, and a technique carved out of old-school cricket books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe lived by discipline. When dropped, he didn\u2019t rant on social media. He went back to Ranji matches, scoring runs on dusty domestic pitches. He went to Sussex and Yorkshire, scoring in the cold English conditions where even stars struggled. His character was built on humility. His career was proof that you don\u2019t need noise to leave an echo.\n\n\n\nSource: Hindustan Times\n\n\n\nA Farewell That Never Happened\n\n\n\nThe hardest part for fans is knowing he never got a farewell match. No one stood up in the stands to cheer his final walk. No chance for teammates to lift him on their shoulders. He simply bowed out unnoticed, almost the way he lived his cricket.\n\n\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s fitting. Pujara never played for spotlight. His gift to Indian cricket was survival, resilience, and dignity. His goodbye carried the same traits.\n\n\n\nSource: Times of India\n\n\n\nThe Legacy He Leaves\n\n\n\nCheteshwar Pujara leaves behind lessons, not just runs. Youngsters will study his forward defense, his concentration, his ability to wait. But more importantly, they\u2019ll learn from his courage the art of standing firm when everything else is falling apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an age obsessed with T20 leagues, he carried the flag of Test cricket. He reminded us that cricket isn\u2019t just entertainment; it\u2019s endurance, patience, and pride. His name now sits next to Rahul Dravid not as a copy, but as his own version of \u201cThe Wall.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Quiet Statement, A Lasting Impact\n\n\n\nAnnouncing his retirement, Pujara wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWearing the Indian jersey, singing the anthem\u2026 it\u2019s impossible to put into words what it truly meant. With immense gratitude, I have decided to retire from all forms of Indian cricket.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWearing the Indian jersey, singing the anthem, and trying my best each time I stepped on the field \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to put into words what it truly meant.

When others attacked, he endured. He wasn\u2019t just a batsman he was the fight we all wish we had.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAnd perhaps that is his real legacy. Not sixes, not strike rates, not even hundreds. But the belief that sometimes, standing still is the greatest act of courage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about:\n\n\n\n\nAre multi-format players extinct?

      "content_full": "\nThe most fascinating thing about cricket as a sport is how everything changes about the game but the rules. The rules of the game have remained almost unchanged throughout the 150 year old history of the game.\n\n\n\nSince the birth of the T20 format there has been a lot of conversation around multi-format players i.e. players who have excelled in all formats of the game and who have the game and skillset required for both red ball resilience and white ball heroics. \n\n\n\nRole players and the t20 batting order\n\n\n\nThe preceding decade dominated by the Indian greats Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli who held their places in all three formats through their career inspite of the T20 format becoming more aggressive and uptempo through the last five years.\n\n\n\nFranchise leagues around the world have seen more and more aggressive brand of cricket every year, with the introduction of role players for every batting position. Role players maximise run-making efficiency with death over boundary hitting which is a far-cry from the old methods of playing white ball cricket which relied on running efficient singles and twos.\n\n\n\nImpact player rules have also turbocharged scoring in the IPL which has changed the game for old school top order anchor batters. The Sunrisers Hyderabad side of the last two IPLs have constructed a side that is based around constant boundary hitting and batting the opposition out of the game in the first innings by scoring titanic totals.\n\n\n\nAlthough they faced a problem with batting collapses, it was an indication of how modern T20 sides are moving past anchor batters that glue together innings rather than going for players based on their roles and their entry points within the game.\n\n\n\n The T20 batting order when compared to the fifty over or test format is much more flexible and depends on entry points of different players based on number of overs left and wickets left in hand.\n\n\n\nThe model of players such as Babar Azam, Kane Williamson, or Joe Root(middle order anchors) who used to maintain the tempo of the innings, now are discarded for players who can keep the run-rate at par even after the openers have taken advantage of the field restrictions of the power-play. T20 run-making now differs fundamentally from ODIs, and the format has evolved to the extent that teams where teams have to think differently about batters whose primary skill is accumulating middle over runs with occasional boundaries.\n\n\n\nConditions dictate a T20 batting innings, if spin is being bowled a spin-friendly batter is sent out, if there are five over left in the innings, a finisher is sent out, if wickets are lost early the anchor is sent out. While batting orders have become more and more rigid in other formats of the game, t20 batting orders are dependent on conditions and fluid in nature.\n\n\n\nMystery spinners and slower balls\n\n\n\nSunil Narine has been a stalwart of KKR in the last generation.\n\n\n\nT20 bowling has also evolved alongside t20 batting so that over the years, t20 bowling also calls for specialists in the format. While line and length are the holy grail in the longer formats of the game, especially in test cricket, the shorter format calls for variations. Slower balls, cutters, and wide yorkers for pacers and googlies and arm balls for the pacers are the law of the land.\n\n\n\nWhile line and length bowlers such as Cummins or Md.Shami seem to be struggling in t20s, bowlers with more variations in their deliveries or slower ball bowlers like Harshal Patel, Prasidh Krishna or Nathan Ellis seem to have more success in t20s. Jasprit Bumrah is the greatest all-format bowler in the world right now because of his relentless line and length and the number of variations he has in his arsenal.\n\n\n\nMore so with spin, we have seen how leg-spin has gone extinct when it comes to red-ball cricket. When it comes to t20s, leggies are flourishing due to their different variations and how difficult it is to pick their different variations and hit boundaries of them. \n\n\n\nMystery spinners with subtle variations between leg breaks, straight deliveries, and off-breaks continually keep the stumps in play and slow down scoring quite a bit.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Mystery Spinners such as Varun Chakravarty, Sunil Narine and Maheesh Theekshana dominate franchise leagues all over the world. They have built their game based around poaching wickets and limiting runs in the t20 format. Their skillsets are specialised for the t20 format based around the evolution of the game in t20s in international and franchise cricket worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe challenge of all-format players\n\n\n\nMulti-format players in the current generation will have the unique challenge of keeping up with a game that is differently paced for all three formats. Each format ofthe game now asks for unique skills which are unique to the specific format of the game.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is why test batters always find themselves too slow when trying to play t20 cricket or not being able to mold themselves into a role player or into the fluid batting orders of t20 cricket while t20 specialists struggle to play long, resilient innings in test cricket. Similarly, for bowlers, t20 cricket requires skills and variations of them that may not be relevant in other formats of the game.\u00a0\n\n\n\nT20 cricket has been evolving rapidly through the last five years and now requires specialists in its own regard. The youngest format of the game is by far the most popular format and refuses to be seen as the most casual format of the game as it used to be during its inception. \n\n\n\n\n",

The win handed the Proteas an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series and marked another historic triumph on Australian soil.\n\n\n\nBreetzke and Stubbs Steady South Africa\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter being put in to bat, South Africa suffered early setbacks with stand in skipper Adien Markram departing for a four-ball duck. Australia\u2019s new pair of Josh Hazlewood and Xavier Bartlett maintained tight lines , making stroke play difficult on a two-paced pitch.\n\n\n\nBreetzke played a fluent knock of 88 from 78 balls, equalling the world record for most consecutive fifties from ODI debut (four in a row). Stubbs provided solid support with a composed 74 off 87 deliveries, ensuring South Africa had a strong platform despite wickets falling around them. Contributions from Wiaan Mulder (26 off 21) and a quick cameo from Keshav Maharaj in the final overs pushed South Africa to 277 all out. Bartlett was Australia\u2019s most impressive bowler, finishing with 2/45 while Adam Zampa chipped in with wickets during the middle overs.\n\n\n\nJosh Inglis Lone Warrior in Australia\u2019s Chase\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nChasing 278, Australia\u2019s innings never gained stability. Nandre Burger struck first, removing Travis Head early, before Lungi Nigidi took centre stage. The pacer produced a devastating spell, dismantling Australia\u2019s batting order with pace and precision. Only Josh Inglis looked capable of mounting a fight. The wicketkeeper batter played a spirited knock of 87 off 74 balls, featuring 10 boundaries and two sixes. He kept the chase alive with partnerships alongside Cameron Green (35) and, later, Alex Carey (13), but once Ngidi removed Inglis, Australia\u2019s hopes faded rapidly.\n\n\n\nNgidi was well supported by Burger ( 2/47) and Senuran Muthusamy, who chipped in with two wickets in the middle overs. Their combined effort ensured Australia slipped to their consecutive ODI series defeat, and notably their third series loss at home to South Africa in the last 17 years.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Dominance Over Australia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis win was more than just a series victory. It further underlined South Africa\u2019s recent dominance over Australia in ODIs. Since 2016, the Proteas have beaten Australia in five successive bilateral ODI series, a remarkable feat considering Australia\u2019s reputation as a powerhouse at home\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Series results since 2016:\n\n\n\n2016: South Africa won 5-0\n\n\n\n2018: South Africa won 2-1\n\n\n\n2020:South Africa won 3-0\n\n\n\n2023: South Africa 3-2\n\n\n\n2025: South Africa lead 2-0 ( with one to play)\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s Concerns\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor Australia, this loss raises serious questions ahead of upcoming assignments. Their batting continues to falter under pressure, with collapses becoming a worrying trend. The absence of big runs players like Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne hurt them, while their bowling attack, despite early discipline, lacked the finishing edge to restrict South Africa below 250.\n\n\n\nWith one match left in this series, Skipper Mitchell Marsh and coach Andrew McDonland will be desperate to avoid a whitewash at home, something that could deal a significant blow to Australia\u2019s confidence.\n\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Lungi Ngidi\n\n\n\nThere was absolutely no debate when it came to deciding the player of the match \u2013 it had to be Lungi Ngidi. The South African speedstar produced a spell a pure quality, finishing with figures of 5 for 42, and completely dismantling Australia\u2019s batting order. Nigdi struck at crucial intervals, removing Marnus Labuschagne early to put the hosts on the back foot, before returning in the middle overs break, he dismissed the well-set Josh Inglis for 87, a wicket that ended the hope of chasing down the target.\n\n\n\nWhat stood out about Ngidi\u2019s performance was not just wickets but his ability to read the conditions and adjust his pace and lenghts smartly. On a surface that offered uneven bounce, Ngidi mixed up his fuller deliveries with deceptive slower balls, keeping the batter guessing throughout. Nigdi\u2019s five wicket haul sealed the win in Mackay and secured the series for South Africa with the game to spare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa will aim for clean sweep in the final ODI , with youngsters Breetzke and Stubbs complementing\u00a0 Nigdi\u2019s experience. Australia meanwhile, must fix its batting lapses to avoid another setback and salvage some pride.\n",

Final group placements:\n\n\n\n\nGroup A: Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Oman.\n\n\n\nGroup B: Tajikistan, Iran, Afghanistan, India.\n\n\n\n\nVenues Across Two Nations\n\n\n\nMatches will be held across three stadiums in two cities:\n\n\n\n\nHisor Central Stadium, Hisor (Tajikistan) \u2013 Capacity: 20,000\n\n\n\nMilliy Stadium, Tashkent (Uzbekistan) \u2013 Capacity: 40,000\n\n\n\nPakhtakor Central Stadium, Tashkent (Uzbekistan) \u2013 Capacity: 35,000\n\n\n\n\nAll of India\u2019s group stage matches will occur at Hisor Central Stadium, while the third-place match is also set for Hisor, and the final will be staged at Milliy Stadium in Tashkent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Entry & Preparatory Context\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s inclusion came after Malaysia\u2019s exit, elevating the stakes as a key preparation opportunity ahead of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifying third round against Singapore in October.

AIFF\u2019s technical committee had recommended Jamil as their top choice earlier in July, ahead of other contenders like Stephen Constantine and Stefan Tarkovic.\n\n\n\nMission & Vision\n\n\n\nStepping into his first international assignment, Jamil emphasized the CAFA Nations Cup as vital preparation: \u201cThis will be beneficial for us to prepare for the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers\u2026 We may be treating these as preparatory games, but this is serious business for us\u201d.\n\n\n\nTeam Dynamics & Sidelining Chhetri\n\n\n\nJamil\u2019s approach focuses on testing new talent and squad depth. His 35-man probable list, which initiated training on 16 August in Bengaluru, omitted veteran striker Sunil Chhetri, citing the opportunity to assess fresh players. Yet, he left \u201cthe door open\u201d for Chhetri\u2019s return, stating they had discussed the decision, and reaffirmed his respect for Chhetri as a role model. The camp began with 22 players, while 13 others, engaged in the Durand Cup, are expected to join soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Statistics & Updates\n\n\n\nCategoryDetailTournament Dates29 August \u2013 8 September 2025HostsTajikistan & UzbekistanNumber of Teams8 (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Tajikistan, Iran, Afghanistan, India)VenuesHisor Central Stadium (20,000); Milliy Stadium (40,000); Pakhtakor Central Stadium (35,000)India Group Matches29 Aug vs Tajikistan, 1 Sep vs Iran, 4 Sep vs AfghanistanCoachKhalid JamilStatus of ChhetriSidelined from initial list; Jamil open to reinstatement\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead: What to Expect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetitive Edge: Group B poses a challenging landscape.

Under the fresh leadership of Shubman Gill, India engaged in an enthralling battle across five historic venues, ultimately sharing the newly instituted Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. Beyond a compelling Test series, India now pivots toward defending their Asia Cup title in the UAE (Sept 9-28), under the guidance of the head coach Gautam Gambhir.\n\n\n\n1st Test \u2013 Headingley, Leeds\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nAt Headingley, Shubman Gill announced himself with a 127-run knock on debut as Test captain, anchoring India\u2019s charge on Day 1. IND, though solid, lacked support, eventually crumbling under England\u2019s bowling resoluteness. The hosts secured a narrow win.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nGill\u2019s century made him the fifth Indian captain to score a century on his Test captaincy debut, joining legends like Hazare and Kohli. While performances from KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja showed promise, England\u2019s disciplined pace led by Josh Tongue proved decisive.\n\n\n\nKey takeaway: A spirited start, but a clear signal that IND needed depth and resilience.\n\n\n\n2nd Test \u2013 Edgbaston, Birmingham\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nGill followed up with another unbeaten ton (114*), guiding India to a strong first-innings position and leveling the series.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nThe back-to-back centuries distinguished Gill among Indian captains. Rahul and Jadeja supported him, and India\u2019s bowling clicked at crucial junctures.\n\n\n\nSeries standing: IND leveled the series 1\u20131.\n\n\n\n3rd Test \u2013 Lord\u2019s, London\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nA nerve-racking contest saw contributions across the board, with Washington Sundar\u2019s four wickets tilting the game as IND narrowly missed victory after England pulled ahead.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s resilience at the \u201cHome of Cricket\u201d was notable. Despite near misses, Sundar\u2019s all-round effort symbolized the team\u2019s growing fighting spirit.\n\n\n\n4th Test \u2013 Old Trafford, Manchester\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nDramatic and enduring IND fought back from unlikely positions, with Gill steering an engaging chase. The test ended in a hard-fought draw.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nThis game was a testament to depth and character. Key players like Gill, Jadeja, and KL Rahul stood tall. England remained potent at home, setting up a grand finale.\n\n\n\n5th Test \u2013 The Oval, London\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nWhat a finale! IND clinched a 6-run victory on the final day, scripted by Mohammed Siraj\u2019s five-wicket spell, to seal the series 2\u20132.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nDefending 374, India held firm. Despite centuries from Root and Brook, IND remained calm. Siraj\u2019s emotional heroics and the dramatic collapse of England, with Chris Woakes bravely batting one-handed, made this one for the ages.\n\n\n\nThe series has been widely hailed as a modern-day classic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics & Highlights of the Tour\n\n\n\nMost Runs:\n\n\n\n\nIndia: Shubman Gill \u2013 754 runs (avg 75.4)\n\n\n\nEngland: Joe Root \u2013 537 runs\n\n\n\n\nMost Wickets:\n\n\n\n\nIndia: Mohammed Siraj \u2013 23 wickets\n\n\n\nEngland: Josh Tongue \u2013 19 wickets\n\n\n\nOthers: Stokes and Bumrah are also in the top five.\n\n\n\n\nPlayer(s) of the Series: Harry Brook (Eng) & Shubman Gill (Ind).\n\n\n\nIndian Captain Shubman Gill was also named as the ICC Player of the Month (July). These milestones are now etched in the inaugural Anderson\u2013Tendulkar Trophy 2025 chapter.\n\n\n\nThe Future: India Under Gautam Gambhir & Asia Cup 2025\n\n\n\nWith the rise of new leaders like Gill and Pant, insights from legends like Gambhir can sharpen vision and strategy in this transformative phase. Internal sources indicate a focus on nurturing pacers and versatile T20 talent in preparation for the Asia Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Cup 2025 \u2013 UAE, Sept 9-28\n\n\n\nThe ACC has confirmed the T20 Asia Cup will be held from Sep 9-28 in the UAE across Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\n\nFormat & Teams: 8 teams split into two groups; IND, Pakistan, UAE, and Oman in Group A.\n\n\n\nIndia vs. Pakistan clash: Set for September 14 in Dubai with high expectations for intense rivalry.\n\n\n\nDefending champions: IND won the 2023 edition and seeks a successful defense.\n\n\n\nSquad buzz: Selection duel looms ahead, with players like Gill, Jaiswal, and Samson in contention.\n\n\n\n\nThe Asia Cup offers a vital T20 preparatory platform leading to the next T20 World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Squad for Asia Cup 2025\n\n\n\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has announced a balanced and dynamic 15-member squad for the Asia Cup 2025, to be played under the leadership of Suryakumar Yadav. Known for his explosive batting, Suryakumar will captain the side, while Shubman Gill has been appointed as vice-captain.\n\n\n\nThe squad features a strong mix of youth and experience. Sanju Samson and Jitesh Sharma will share wicket-keeping responsibilities, while all-round options like Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, and Shivam Dube provide depth in both batting and bowling. The batting order boasts talents such as Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, and Rinku Singh, who have all impressed in recent series.\n\n\n\nIn the bowling department, Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh lead the pace attack, supported by Harshit Rana as a rising talent. The spin unit includes Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy, giving India variety and control in the middle overs.\n\n\n\nWith Gautam Gambhir as the head coach, the squad reflects a bold new era of Indian cricket, blending attacking flair with strategic depth, as the Men in Blue aim to defend their Asia Cup title.\n\n\n\nFull Squad:\n\n\n\nSuryakumar Yadav (C)Shubman Gill (VC)Abhishek SharmaSanju Samson (WK)Tilak VarmaHardik PandyaRinku SinghJitesh Sharma (WK)Axar PatelShivam DubeKuldeep YadavVarun ChakravarthyHarshit RanaJasprit BumrahArshdeep Singh\n\n\n\nHead Coach: Gautam Gambhir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTour of England Ends All Square: Gambhir-Led IND Set Sights on Defending the Asia Cup Title\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s 2025 England tour delivered drama, resilience, and unforgettable cricket. The 2-2 draw, etched with epic individual efforts, heralded a new chapter under Shubman Gill\u2019s leadership.

      "content_full": "\nAjit Agarkar, chief selector, and captain Suryakumar Yadav announced India\u2019s 15-member squad for the Asia Cup on August 19, 2025. The team is around the expected squad, but there will be a conversation about Shreyas Iyer\u2019s exclusion. Agarkar explained the team wasn\u2019t left out of the squad because of his form, but due to competition for places.\n\n\n\nThe best news is that Jasprit Bumrah is back, the most crucial player to return to India\u2019s bowling attack. Another interesting development in the squad announcement is the change of vice-captaincy. Shubman Gill has replaced Axar Patel, further adding to the uncertainty in this position. Gill\u2019s rise indicates that India\u2019s selectors have confidence in him as a long-term leader.\n\n\n\nGill as vice-captain means that there will be someone left out of the top order, and all indications suggest that it would be Sanju Samson. India will be intent on winning the Asia Cup with this squad, and the target will be to compete on September 14 against Pakistan in Dubai, which could be a table-pitched match in the Super 4s, and possibly a final.\n\n\n\nStrengths of Indian Team\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s batting line-up for the Asia Cup looks utterly menacing. Whether it\u2019s Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, or Sanju Samson at the top, that top order will always be explosive. With Tilak Varma at 3 and the unpredictable Suryakumar Yadav at 4.\n\n\n\nTheir middle-order runs even deeper with Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel, both powerful hitters, and some finishers \u2013 Rinku Singh or Shivam Dube. If Jitesh Sharma is playing instead of Samson, he adds another dangerous option lower down. The batting line-up has so much depth that with any of them at 7 or 8, they could be a match-winner.\n\n\n\nTheir bowling unit is just as talented. With Dubai hosting the games, Varun Chakravarthy will be a big asset after his Champions Trophy tournament earlier this year. At the same time, we have a class pace-unit, with the world-class duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh. Now firmly established as India\u2019s first-choice T20 duo since 2024. Together, they certainly have both batting and bowling to win the Asia Cup.\n\n\n\nWeaknesses or Concerns\n\n\n\nThere is no such thing as weakness in this Indian squad. Only a few little things that might trouble the team during the tournament.\n\n\n\nSince assuming captaincy, Suryakumar Yadav\u2019s batting has nosedived. In 22 innings, he\u2019s only scored 558 runs at an average of 26.57, with one hundred and four fifties \u2013 a staggering drop from his numbers before captaincy. Previously, in 61 innings without captaincy pressure, he scored 2,040 runs at 43.40, including 3 hundreds and 17 fifties. Despite having a decent record as captain, it looks like the weight of captaincy blunts his batting. It is unfortunate for a team that was previously excited about their most reliable T20 run-scorer.\n\n\n\nThe second concern that comes to my mind is playing spin. We\u2019ve seen a lot in recent times that India finds it difficult to score runs against spin as they did against pace. The run-rate suddenly dips as soon as the spinner comes into the game. Afghanistan, having 2-3 quality spinners, will test India\u2019s batting talent and depth. It would be good to see who will take on the spinners during the middle overs in the absence of Shreyas.\n\n\n\nOpportunities for India\n\n\n\nThe Asia Cup presents an ideal stage for players like Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, Jitesh Sharma, Rinku Singh, and Shivam Dube to make their case for next year\u2019s T20 World Cup. In addition, Shubman Gill\u2019s return after a year of absence is another storyline. If he performs, then the probability of his being made India\u2019s all-format captain after the home World Cup next year is almost a foregone conclusion.\n\n\n\nFor others, the stakes are defining. Kuldeep Yadav, if given a chance, can establish himself for the ambitious BCCI\u2019s long-term plan. It\u2019 not that he has anything to prove, just an opportunity is no one\u2019s enemy; he could resurrect himself. Meanwhile, Varun Chakaravarthy has the chance to step up as India\u2019s No. 1 white-ball spinner, seizing a long-term claim in conditions that favour his art.\n\n\n\nThreats from Opponents\n\n\n\nTheir line-up is full of stroke players who can clear boundaries at will. The primary question is whether they have batters that can adapt to slow, low pitches. On slow pitches, rotating the strike and getting runs becomes as important as hitting boundaries.\n\n\n\nVirat Kohli was able to read conditions and adapt his game, while Shreyas Iyer is India\u2019s best player of spin. Now, without Kohli, having retired from T20s, and Iyer not even being a standby, India will start the Asia Cup without two of their best anchors against teams that predominantly bowl spin.\n\n\n\nThe conditions in the UAE also play into the hands of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, who have great spin options, and even the hosts, the UAE, boast good quality spinners. While the T20 format has a way of leveling the playing field, these factors could give formidable rivals a better opportunity to halt India\u2019s juggernaut.\n\n\n\n\n",

Soon, both of these players were nowhere to be seen in the top 100 listing, which caused confusion and anger, and a certain number of wild guesses on social media within a relatively brief period of time. Within a matter of hours, the ICC issued declarations that the exclusion was not a decision but a result of a technical error. Nevertheless, the entire affair caused people to consider the significance of the ranking, as well as the value of Kohli and Sharma to the Indian cricket.\n\n\n\nA Sudden Disturbance!\n\n\n\nICC weekly rankings update captures the role of players that rise and fall based on their recent performances. This week was, however, not the normal report. The fans were surprised at the fact that the names of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma did not feature on the ODI batting charts. Neither of the two was ranked in the very top 100 in spite of playing in India on the Champions Trophy earlier this year.\n\n\n\nno virat kohli & rohit sharma in the top 10 icc odi rankings\ud83d\udc80 only these two are missing\u2026. what's happening- pic.twitter.com/r7XKxutESr\u2014 ` (@cupc4ke77) August 20, 2025\n\n\n\nThis was an outrageous error. Rohit remains the first and only batsman to score three double centuries in ODIs, and Kohli stands third on the list of run-scorers in ODIS with 14,181 runs. Did the ICC intend to remove them? Were they having their records reviewed? These were the questions that dominated fan debates and news on August 19th.\n\n\n\nICC\u2019s Clarification Ahead of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma\u2019s Exclusion from the ODI Rankings:\n\n\n\nAs this news broke out, the ICC issued a formal statement explaining that a data integration problem in the rankings system was the reason why Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma were left off the list. The governing body alleges that the inability to update player information took place during the update of the player information after South Africa had played the ODI match with Australia, which was completed. They explained that selectors left out some players, such as Rohit and Kohli: The rankings did not match properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ICC spokesperson admitted the mistake. \u201cThere was an error in our rankings tables today, but it has been rectified,\u201d the official said. [Source: Hindustan Times]. \n\n\n\nVirat Kohli and Rohit Sharma\u2019s ICC ODI Rankings were restored by the evening; however, it is noteworthy that they are now ranked lower than in prior years. Given their few ODI performances in recent months, Rohit is ranked 2nd, while Kohli is ranked 4th. \n\n\n\nAbsence of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma from ODIs:\n\n\n\nDiscussions on Rohit and Kohli\u2019s diminishing participation in the ODI format also reignited. Both these players have played a minimal number of ODI matches since the 2023 ODI World Cup ended in India. \n\n\n\n\nVirat Kohli\u2019s Last ODI was on March against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy. During this match, he made just 1 run and Bracewell dismissed him. Despite these figures, he scored 218 runs averaging 54.50 and a strike rate of 82.89 in the Champions Trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\nRohit Sharma also played his last ODI against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy, and this time it was Rohit Sharma who scored a match-winning knock in this final; the player of the match award was given to Rohit Sharma. He scored 76 in 83 balls. Rohit Sarma scored 180 runs in this Champions Trophy, through which he got an average of 36.00 with a strike rate of 100.00.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma\u2019s Era Going to End?\n\n\n\nThough the mistake with the rankings only lasted for a short time period, it brought to light one larger truth: are Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma nearing their final days in ODI cricket? Because they have already called it a day in T20 and ODIs. Whether these two legends will appear in the upcoming series of India vs Australia ODIs is the question.\n\n\n\nThe removal of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma from the ICC ODI rankings was one of the technological blunders that shook the cricketing world momentarily. Although their names have since been reinstated, the episode highlighted the realities of the generational changeover going on in cricket as well as the instability of ranking systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, Kohli and Rohit might not be as dominant in the ODI tables anymore as they were, but one must admit they have left their mark on the game. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma shall live on in the memories of their billions of cricket fans as people to be proud of. This can be a mere technical fault, but this is a wake-up call that even as the two cricket giants are approaching the ned of their cricket careers, they will always be remembered in the history of the game of cricket through their achievements in the game.\n\n\n\n\n",

While the move was lauded for promoting gender equality, it also sparked debate across cricketing circles. Does equal pay reflect fairness in effort, or does it ignore stark differences in revenue, popularity, and viewership?\n\n\n\nWhat the Equal Pay Policy Entails\n\n\n\nUnder the BCCI\u2019s revised payment structure:\n\n\n\n\nTest match fee: \u20b915 lakh\n\n\n\nODI match fee: \u20b96 lakh\n\n\n\nT20I match fee: \u20b93 lakh\n\n\n\n\nThis is now applicable regardless of gender, meaning Smriti Mandhana and Virat Kohli receive the same amount per match, assuming both are selected and play.\n\n\n\nA Progressive Step Toward Equality\n\n\n\nThe advocates justify that women deserved equal match fees long ago. Women cricketers also have to face training routines, diet, travel and emotional stress as much as their male counterparts. The demands of skill performance in the field are also similar to that of gender.\n\n\n\nConsider these examples:\n\n\n\n\nHarmanpreet Kaur\u2019s 171 (off 115 balls) against Australia* in the 2017 Women\u2019s World Cup semifinal remains one of the greatest knocks in Indian cricket history\u2014across genders.\n\n\n\nJemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, and Renuka Singh have consistently emerged as high-impact players on the world stage.\n\n\n\n\nYet, for years, the match fees were drastically lower for women\u2014until the 2022 policy shift.\n\n\n\nBut Is It Financially Justified?\n\n\n\nThe economics of cricket, however, paint a different picture.\n\n\n\nViewership & Fanbase Disparity:\n\n\n\nTournamentAvg. Viewership (India)Men\u2019s 2023 ODI World Cup Final130 million+ (Disney+ Hotstar)Women\u2019s 2023 T20 WC Final (vs. AUS)~20 million\n\n\n\n\nThe India vs Pakistan Men\u2019s World Cup match in 2023 attracted 3.5 crore concurrent viewers.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, even WPL (Women\u2019s Premier League) averages significantly lower TV ratings, although the 2023 season did cross 50 million unique viewers\u2014a promising sign.\n\n\n\n\nSponsorship and Advertising\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s cricket remains a growing market, with WPL helping shift perception but still far from parity in terms of commercial draw.\n\n\n\nIn FY 2023, BCCI\u2019s revenue exceeded \u20b95,000 crore, the majority of which stemmed from men\u2019s cricket (IPL, bilateral series, and ICC tournaments).\n\n\n\nSymbolism vs Sustainability\n\n\n\nThe equal pay move is as much about symbolism as it is about policy. It sends a message: women\u2019s cricket is no longer an afterthought. This decision lays the groundwork for:\n\n\n\n\nGrassroots encouragement for girls to take up cricket professionally.\n\n\n\nCorporate investment in female cricketers and leagues like the WPL.\n\n\n\nA shift in cultural perception\u2014from novelty to legitimacy.\n\n\n\n\nYet, critics argue that equal match fees may not yet be economically sustainable without structural reform. Should match fees be proportional to viewership revenue until parity is reached? Or is this exactly the kind of leap of faith that drives change?\n\n\n\nWhat Cricketers Are Saying\n\n\n\n\nSmriti Mandhana (2022): \u201cThis is a big move not just for us, but for the future generation of women cricketers. It shows that our board believes in our value.\u201d\n\n\n\nSunil Gavaskar (2023): \u201cEqual pay is a great goal, but for long-term sustainability, women\u2019s cricket must also focus on improving marketing, fan engagement, and quality of competition.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: Equal Pay, Unequal World\n\n\n\nMatch fee equalization is certainly a forward-looking decision-but that does not happen in a bubble. Even the sport of women remains behind in terms of the number of spectators, products, and even culture. Equal match fees are not retroactive to decades of inequity, but they are a key steppingstone into a brighter future.\n\n\n\nAnd while fairness shouldn\u2019t always be dictated by market forces, sustainable growth will depend on whether the women\u2019s game can now convert policy wins into commercial strength.\n",

The path to deeper fan engagement isn\u2019t mysterious\u2014it just requires visibility, storytelling, and investment. Here\u2019s how to actually grow the audience instead of just lamenting its absence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime-Time, Not Marginal Time\n\n\n\nVisibility is everything. Most women\u2019s matches are slotted during non-prime hours\u2014weekday afternoons or early mornings\u2014which means potential fans miss out by default. High-stakes games deserve weekend slots and evening broadcasts, when working professionals and students can tune in easily. Broadcasters should also stop treating women\u2019s games as pre-shows for men\u2019s double-headers. When the Indian women\u2019s team played a prime-time T20 match vs. Australia in 2022, over 47,000 fans filled DY Patil Stadium. That wasn\u2019t a one-off\u2014it was proof of concept.\n\n\n\nBuild Personalities, Not Just Stats\n\n\n\nFans fall in love with players, not just performances. Yet, how many fans know what makes Smriti Mandhana tick off the field? Or the journey that brought Saika Ishaque to the WPL spotlight? The men\u2019s game thrives on rivalries, friendships, and redemption arcs\u2014the women\u2019s game needs the same. Platforms like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and Spotify interviews can be used to build character-driven content. Imagine a Netflix-style docuseries on the Indian women\u2019s team\u2014not just highlights, but heartbreaks, dressing room moments, and dreams. That\u2019s how loyalty is built.\n\n\n\nChange the Commentary, Change the Narrative\n\n\n\nCommentary in women\u2019s cricket still struggles with tone and insight. Often, it feels like an educational pitch to viewers\u2014or worse, unfamiliar voices trying to fake familiarity. What\u2019s needed is authenticity. More former women cricketers should be behind the mic\u2014names like Lisa Sthalekar, Snehal Pradhan, and Ebony Rainford-Brent bring experience and respect. The more relatable the coverage feels, the more invested fans become. The goal isn\u2019t to over-explain; it\u2019s to celebrate the game with the same passion and pace as the men\u2019s.\n\n\n\nKeep the Cameras Rolling Beyond the Game\n\n\n\nA major reason men\u2019s cricket feels omnipresent is because content never stops. From press conferences to hotel vlogs to birthday celebrations, fans are always fed. The same should apply to women\u2019s cricket. Document practice sessions. Highlight sibling bonds, friendships (like Jemimah Rodrigues and Heather Graham\u2019s), or even the offbeat rituals of players. These micro-moments build macro followings. The BCCI, ICC, and franchises need dedicated digital teams focused on short-form content just for the women\u2019s game.\n\n\n\nGrassroots + Glamour = Sustainable Growth\n\n\n\nBoosting the women\u2019s game isn\u2019t just about top-tier matches. Schools, colleges, and districts need infrastructure and incentives. Just like U-19 boys\u2019 tournaments get eyeballs, a structured, well-covered women\u2019s U-19 ecosystem would not only find talent\u2014it would build regional fanbases. Add to that strategic marketing: stylish kits, personality-driven branding, or even curated theme nights (like WNBA\u2019s Pride Nights) during WPL. Cricket is still conservative with its image\u2014but that can change tastefully.\n\n\n\nFinal Over: Invest Like You Mean It\n\n\n\nNone of this works without belief at the top. Brands, broadcasters, and boards have to stop seeing women\u2019s cricket as a checkbox. Investment must be consistent, not reactionary. If given the same storytelling tools, production value, and creative space, there\u2019s no reason the women\u2019s game can\u2019t draw its own cult following\u2014not as a shadow of the men\u2019s sport, but as a different, equally thrilling version of cricket.\n\n\n\nThe fans are out there. They just need something real to hold on to.\n",

      "content_full": "\nWhen Pakistan announced their squad for their Asia Cup 2025, the spotlight immediately fell on two glaring omissions: Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. Once the cornerstones\u00a0 of the Pakistan batting unit, the duo were left out due to long-standing concerns over their strike rates in T20 cricket. Since new White Ball head coach Mike Hesson took over, he has made one thing clear \u2013 Pakistan must prioritize strike rate and intent over accumulation of runs. The member squad reflects that shift in philosophy.\n\n\n\nWith Sam Ali Agha appointed as a captain, Pakistan will field a largely youthful unit that is built for Agression .\u00a0 But while the Squad\u00a0 has genuine firepower at the top and variety, blowing the middle order could once again become their biggest weakness .\u00a0 Let\u2019s break down the side of a classic SWOT analysis:\n\n\n\nStrengths: Explosive Top order and strong pace attack:\n\n\n\nThe biggest strength of this Pakistan squad is undoubtedly its top depth. Instead\u00a0 of persisting with Babar and Rizwan, Pakistan has gone with more attacking players.\n\n\n\n\nSahibzada Farhan has been in brilliant touch, scoring three fifties in just six games this year at a strike rate of nearly 145.\n\n\n\nSaim Ayub, though inconsistent, is a natural stroke maker with the kind of fearless batting Pakistan often craves.\n\n\n\nFakhar Zaman remains a proven match winner capable of turning games on his day.\n\n\n\nMohammad Harris, who will also keep wickets, has a career strike rate of almost 55, a  rare quality in the Pakistan batting lineup.\n\n\n\n\nTogether this top order ensures Pakistan will not be left behind in the power play, something that has often been hampered in the past.\n\n\n\nEqually strong is Pakistan \u2018 s fast blowing unit. The trio of\u00a0 Shaheen Shah Afridi, Harris Rauf, and Hasan Ali provides experience Pace and wicket-taking ability. Backups like Mohammad Wasim Jr. and newcomer Salman Mizara add both depth and variety. With conditions in the UAE likely to favor seamers under lights, this attack could be one of Pakistan \u2018s biggest assets.\n\n\n\nWeakness: A Fragile Middle Order\n\n\n\nIf the Top order is Pakistan \u2018 s armor then the middle order is the crack that the Opponents look to exploit\n\n\n\n\nSam Ali Agha, though consistent in terms of average, strikes at just 124 in T20Is this year, which is not ideal for a No. 4 batter.\n\n\n\n Hussian Talat has barley played this year raising doubts about his match\u00a0 readiness\n\n\n\n Khushdil Shah \u2018 s\u00a0 poor numbers average below 15 and strike rate under 100 make his inclusion puzzling.\n\n\n\n\nThe only shining light is Hasan Nawaz, a youngster who has hit 27 sixes in just 14 innings since his debut. Initially tried as an Opener he has been pushed down to stabilize the middle order and could be Pakistan \u2018 s\u00a0 wildcard. Still with so many question marks, Pakistan \u2018 s\u00a0 middle overs could stall momentum, a dangerous weakness in modern T20 cricket, where teams need acceleration throughout.\n\n\n\nOpportunities: A New Face to Shine:\n\n\n\nThe absence of stalwarts like Babar and Rizwan gives Pakistan \u2018 s new crop of batters a golden chance. Farhan Ayub, Haris, and Nawaz\u00a0 all have the opportunity to cement their places for the long term. Similarly, the Asia Cup is the perfect platform for young bowlers like Salman Mizara and Sufiyan Muqeem to gain experience against quality opposition. If they deliver in pressure situations, Pakistan could unearth long-term match winners.\n\n\n\nFor head coach Mike Hesson, this tournament is also a testing ground for his aggressive philosophy. If Pakistan succeeds, it could redefine their approach in T20 cricket for years to come.\n\n\n\nThreats: Inconsistency and Tournament Pressure\n\n\n\nAs always with Pakistan, unpredictability looms large. This team has talent in abundance but its reliance on individual brilliance rather than collective stability is a potential threat. A couple of quick wickets at the top could expose the shaky middle order, leaving too much for Blowers to do. Another concern is Pakistan record in multinational tournaments. Players like Mohammad Nawaz, despite domestic success, have historically underperformed on big stages. Add to this the instance spotlight of facing India and Sri Lanka and the mental pressure could be just as decisive as skill.\n\n\n\nBalanced but Unpredictable\n\n\n\nOverall, the Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 squad is a mix of youth, intent and firepower. Their top order and blowing attack can rival any side but the middle-order conundrum remains unresolved. If the likes of Hasan Nawaz and Saim Ayub step up, Pakistan could well surprise critics. But they flatter the lack of experience and stability in the middle, which could prove costly.\u00a0 Pakistan remain Cricket \u2018 s engima \u2013 dangerous yet unpredictable. Their Asia Cup journey will depend on whether youthful flair can overcome middle-order fragility.\n\n\n\n\n",

Here\u2019s the full squad:\n\n\n\n\nHarmanpreet Kaur (C): Harmanpreet Kaur, who is currently leading the Indian women\u2019s team and is an all-rounder and has never failed to display signs of being a captain, so this Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025 World Cup will be her first World Cup as its captain. She set another record as the first Indian woman to score a century in a T20I match back in 2018. Here\u2019s her batting stats in ODIs:\n\n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsRunsAverageStrike RateHigh Score100s50sODI149129406937.775.9171*719\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarmanpreet Kaur debuted in ODIs in 2009 at the Bradman Oval during the World Cup, against Pakistan. She was named captain of the ODI team in 2013 during the India vs Bangladesh series. Kaur concluded the series with 195 runs at a 97.50 average, two wickets, a century, and a fifty. \n\n\n\n2. Smriti Mandhana (VC): The left-handed batsman and the present captain of the Indian team is 4th on the list of most ODI centuries in women\u2019s cricket. The first Indian woman to score a century across all formats is Smriti Mandhana. Including the Cricketer of the Year award and ODI Cricketer of the Year, she has won 4 ICC awards.\n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsRunsAverageStrike RateHigh Score100s50sODI105105458846.387.81361131\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmriti Mandhana debuted in ODI on 10th April 2013 against Bangladesh, where the exceptional aspect is that she was merely 16 years old, scoring 25 runs off 35 balls. It will be the 3rd ODI World Cup in the career of Smriti Mandhana in this Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025. Smriti Mandhana is a force to reckon with in all formats, and this lady has grace and ferociousness rolled into one.\n\n\n\n3. Jemimah Rodrigues: The all-rounder of the Indian women\u2019s team, Jemimah Rodrigues, has already ensured that she will play in the ensuing Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025. In U-19, she made an excellent score of 202 runs in 163 balls and was only next to Smriti Mandhana.. In 2022, Asia Cup, Jemimah made 217 runs in 6 innings with an average of 54.25.\n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsRunsAverageStrike RateHigh Score100s50sODI5048143932.788.212327\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJemimah made her ODI debut against Australia in Reliance Stadium in 2018. She has also assisted India to their 2nd-highest chase when she scored a 90-run partnership out of an ODI in a high-stress scenario as India defeated England in Southampton. Jemimah is a valuable asset for the Indian women\u2019s team ahead of the Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025.\n\n\n\n4. Pratika Rawal: Pratika Rawal is a young player in Indian women\u2019s cricket, having fearless batting and fine all-round skills. She has already become an Indian to reckon with in the future, owing to her first century against Ireland and her name as being the quickest female cricket player to reach 500 runs in ODIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsRunsAverageStrike RateHigh Score100s50sODIs141470354.187.415415\n\n\n\n5. Richa Ghosh (WK): Richa Ghosh is a fearless batter, and she also  has some incredible wicket-keeping skills; she is a right-handed wicket-keeper batswoman of the Indian team. Richa Ghosh strikes at the fastest rate (142.45) in Women\u2019s T20 Internationals. She made a world record for the fastest 50 in a Women\u2019s T20Is in 2024, and this record was achieved in 18 balls.\n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsRunsAverageStrike RateHigh Score100s50sODI403885028.398.09606\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRicha then made her debut in ODIs, against Australia, in 2021, in Mackay. Richa Ghosh is one such player with her explosive power of batting and great wicketkeeping skills in Indian women\u2019s cricket. Her growing ODI consistency makes her a crucial addition to the Indian team for the Women\u2019s World Cup 2025.\n\n\n\n6. Sneh Rana: Sneh Rana, an all-rounder and right-arm off-spin bowler, has shown her suitability both in ODIs and Tests. From her 10-wicket test haul to her 15-wicket haul in the Tri-Nation ODI series, she always proved herself. Rana also showed her charm with the bat. In ODIs, she has 222 runs in 23 innings with a strike rate of 83.5. \n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsWicket TakenBest BowlingStrike RateEconomyAverageBalls BowledODIs3535475/4336.24.6227.91700\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSneh Rana made her debut in ODIs in 2014, against Sri Lanka. Sneh Rana is a real-life example of influence and perseverance. A dependable spinner and handy part-time lower-order bat, she is particularly recognised for putting in transformation bowling performances in all formats of the game, inclusive of match-defining spells in ODIs in breaking records to match-dominating performances in Tests.\n\n\n\n7. Deepti Sharma: Deepti Sharma is among the most dependable and versatile all-rounders in Indian women\u2019s cricketing circles at present. She has an opening stand of 320 with Punam Raut, which is outstanding; she has scored those runs with Poonam Raut as well in that opening stand against Ireland, which is the highest opening run partnership break in Women\u2019s ODI history.\n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsWicket TakenBest BowlingStrike RateEconomyAverageBalls BowledODIs1091081366/2039.84.2328.15416\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeepti Sharma broke into the ODI scene in Bengaluru against South Africa in the year 2014. It is the 3 rd ODI World Cup of Deepti Sharma. Deepti ranked the 2nd Indian woman to acquire 300 international wickets. The fact that she has a game to change with bat and balls is what makes her very important to the Indian team in the Women\u2019s World Cup in 2025.\n\n\n\n8. Renuka Singh: Left-hand medium pace Renuka Singh Thakur has become the pillar of the Indian bowling lineup in a short time. Her most notable achievement came in the silver medal run of India in the 2022 Commonwealth Games performance and the first Indian, male or female, to take a five-wicket haul in the 2023 T20 World Cup. \n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsWicket TakenBest BowlingStrike RateEconomyAverageBalls BowledODIs1919355/2927.24.8522.0953\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenuka Singh debuted in ODI during the year 2022 against New Zealand. However, in case she receives a selection in the Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025, it will be her debut ODI World Cup. She rose to become the best pace weapon in India in December 2024 following a mesmeric 5/29 against the West Indies. Because of wicket-taking consistency in all formats, she is an inseparable piece in the Indian arsenal as India gears towards future events like the Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025.\n\n\n\n9. Kranti Goud: Kranti Goud is one of the most promising up and coming generation of fast bowlers in Indian women cricket who is known to bowl without fear on the field and her inswingers. She is the youngest Indian bowler to achieve the tag of six-wicket haul; she shocked the cricketing community when she first did this record against England just weeks after her debut.\n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsWicket TakenBest BowlingStrike RateEconomyAverageBalls BowledODIs4496/5217.95.8817.6161\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2025, Kranti was called up for the first time nationally as an up-number, to compete in the Sri Lanka Tri-Nation Series and replace the injured Kashvee Gautam. On 2025 May 11, she appeared in the ODI final. Kranti holds the potential of pace attack of India in the future because of her capability to swing the ball, blend similar elements of aggression and poise, and perform under pressure. Given a chance, she would become a key piece in the Indian wheel ahead of the Women\u2019s World Cup 2025.\n\n\n\n10. Radha Yadav: A very talented and left-arm spinning bowler, Radha Yadav has emerged as one of the key players of the Indian women\u2019s team cricket due to her accuracy, variety, and how she was able to keep her calm even in the most difficult situations. Radha became a known Indian woman after making a world record of taking five wickets in Twenty20 internationals. A talented bowler herself, a swift fielder, and an efficient lower-order batsman, she is also an invaluable team member.\n\n\n\nFORMATMatches PlayedInningsWicket TakenBest BowlingStrike RateEconomyAverageBalls BowledODIs8884/6954.25.3248.1434\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadha debuted in ODIs against South Africa in 2021. Radha Yadav is determined and resilient. The age and experience of any kind of games make Radha an invaluable asset to Indian women cricket.\n\n\n\nYastika Bhatia, Shefali Verma, Harleen Deol, Uma Chhetri, and Gongadi Trisha are also the players who can take part in the central role in the Women\u2019s World Cup 2025, if they get selected.\n\n\n\nSmriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Harmanpreet Kaur are already selected for the World Cup. They were seen together at the \u201850 Days To Go\u2019 event in Mumbai, and Harmanpreet Kaur said that \u201d (The plan is the) same as my first ODI World Cup. I want to go there and enjoy my cricket, but playing in front of the home crowd is always special,\u201d. \n\n\n\nThe countdown has begun!We are now just 50 days away from ICC Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup, 2025. India previously hosted the Women\u2019s @cricketworldcup in 1978, 1997 and 2013. #CWC25 pic.twitter.com/HEqoLflqqc\u2014 BCCI Women (@BCCIWomen) August 11, 2025 \n\n\n\nIndia has a fantastic chance to finally capture the cherished title at the 2025 Women\u2019s ODI World Cup. This year could be the year when India breaks the World Cup jinx and makes history if Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s team can combine skill and elegance. \n",

The omission echoed deeper than selection; it resonated as a farewell to an era. Chhetri, at 40, had reversed his retirement in 2024 and offered glimpses of brilliance scoring against Maldives and striving against Bangladesh and Hong Kong in the Asian Cup qualifiers.\n\n\n\nThere was no formal explanation.

Yes, it meant saying a reluctant goodbye to a legend, but also welcoming a new beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis moment, as emotional as it is delicate, is rich with symbolism.

For South Africa, it marks their third last-over final defeat in the last year.\n\n\n\nBrevis\u2019 blitz set the tone before Maxwell\u2019s heroics\n\n\n\nDewald Brevis was in intimidating form heading into the series decider following his 125-run knock. He announced himself with a swivel-pull over the roof of the stadium from the fifth ball he faced. Brevis continued to bash the bowlers, top-edging Josh Hazlewood for a six and then ripping into Aaron Hardie, hitting four sixes in one over, which went for 27 runs.\n\n\n\nBrevis\u2019s half-century came from just 22 balls, and he looked set for yet another century before Glenn Maxwell got him out. While trying to hit Nathan Ellis over long-on, Brevis was fooled by Maxwell\u2019s incredible diving catch. He was running to his right to take a brilliant catch, which was also his second incredible catch of the series after taking Rickelton on the rope in the first match.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s innings started slowly with Aiden Markram going for one, Rickelton for 13, and Lhuan-dre Pretorius for 24. It was only when Brevis started his fireworks partnered with Tristan Stubbs (25), the innings picked up pace before Rassie van der Dussen scored 38 not out off 26 balls, taking South Africa to 172 for 7. Ellis ended with the ball for 3 for 31 while Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa picked up two each.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s Strong Start Unravels in 18 Balls\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s chase started well with Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head racing the side to 64 without loss in the first seven overs, their first fifty-run opening partnership in eight innings. Marsh was put down on 25 by Rabada off his bowling, and once Marsh got that life, he cashed in to make his first T20I half-century in 19 innings, with more explosive hitting, including a flicked six over square leg.\n\n\n\nJust as Australia started to look comfortable, Markram\u2019s instinct to bowl himself got the momentum back for South Africa. In Markram\u2019s second over, he almost held onto a brilliant return catch in the direction of Head, before he gained success two balls later to dismiss him. Once they got that first wicket, everything changed. The next over, Corbin Bosch bowled Josh Inglis for a golden duck, while Maphaka hat-tricked Marsh and Cameron Green on the boundary. In 18 balls, Australia lost 4 for 22 and had right back in South Africa\u2019s contest.\n\n\n\nMaxwell delivers the big finish\n\n\n\nGlenn Maxwell stood on 39 off 25, and with 27 runs needed from three overs, Kagiso Rabada was preparing to bowl his last over. The outcome was uncertain. Rabada started with a full toss over the batter\u2019s head, called a no-ball, and punished him with the free hit by launching one into the crowd. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the next delivery, he took a single to bring his 30-ball fifty.\n\n\n\nIt must have started to feel like it was all within reach. 12 runs were needed with two overs to go, and with Maxwell on the crease, it had to favor Australia. He hit a boundary early in the last and rightfully finished the chase by reverse scooping Lungi Ngidi over short third for a four. Australia won by two wickets with a ball to spare. For South Africa, Bosch had a good performance, picking up three, with Rabada and teenager Kwena Maphaka both sharing two.\n\n\n\nContrasting series fortunes\n\n\n\nThis victory in Cairns extended Australia\u2019s unbeaten streak in bilateral T20I series to seven, a period that has showcased both their resilience under pressure, as well as the different match-winners they have unearthed across formats. Of the previous six T20I series in that stretch, this was the first time a series had progressed to a decider. The coolness of the final phases of the decider lent more legitimacy to their claim to being one of the most reliable sides in pressure situations.\n\n\n\nOn the other side, this was more frustrating for South Africa. They now have one series win in their last ten T20I matches. They continually fall short in tight finish situations. This is now their third consecutive last-ball defeat in a final \u2013 after the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup and last month\u2019s tri-series final in Zimbabwe. Despite consistent performances from Dewald Brevis and Tristan Stubbs and a fine spell by their young quicks, poor execution in key moments continued to overshadow their development.\n",

Winning the Super Cup set the wheels in motion, but the real pressure test came in that nail-biting qualifier against Al Seeb. Every pass had meaning, every tackle had bite, and every run was made with heart. Goa followed their plan, adapted when needed, and took their chances.

On May 3, they brushed aside Jamshedpur FC with a dominant 3-0 win in the final, owning the night from start to finish. Borja Herrera was unstoppable, scoring twice with style to claim Man of the Match.

      "content_full": "\nCricket is not a game but a culture and part of the heritage and a way different people of different generations communicate with each other. The big names on the field will, of course, get the headlines, but it is the stadiums where their games are held that will carry the memories, emotions, and story of the sport. It can be the serene beauty of Lord\u2019s or the deafening din of Eden Gardens; each of these iconic grounds has got a story to tell and an atmosphere that just wholly captivates the fan.\n\n\n\n1. Lord\u2019s London\u2014The Home of Cricket:\n\n\n\nNo conversation about cricket\u2019s iconic stadiums is complete without Lord\u2019s. Located in\u00a0St. John\u2019s Wood, London, this historic venue has been hosting matches since 1814. Known as the \u201cHome of Cricket,\u201d it combines Victorian charm with modern facilities, including the futuristic Media Center. The famous slope on the pitch adds unpredictability to games, while Long Rooms and Honours boards preserve cricket\u2019s proud traditions. From Don Bradman\u2019s brilliance to Ben Stokes\u2019s 2019 heroics. Lord\u2019s remains the ultimate stage where history is written.\n\n\n\n2. Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG)\u2014Australia\u2014The Colossus\n\n\n\nLord\u2019s Stadium can be considered the heart of cricket in a way, but the actual heart of cricket is in Melbourne Cricket Ground, or MCG. It has over one hundred thousand seats, and it is one of the largest stadiums in the world. The venue turns nutty when supporters are excited, such as during Boxing Day Tests or World Cup finals. In 2015, India won the World Cup there, and Warne pulled off some magic Ashes spells in exactly the same lights. Due to such reasons, the MCG is a national landmark in Australia and not a stadium.\n\n\n\n3. Eden Gardens, Kolkata\u2014The Mecca of Indian cricket\n\n\n\nEden Gardens is where cricket meets raw emotion. Built in 1864, it has been the stage for many of India\u2019s defining cricket moments, such as VVS Laxman\u2019s 281 against Australia in 2001. With capacity once exceeding 100000, crowd energy here is spine-tingling. Victories bring unrestrained joy; defeats bring deep silence, whether during the World Cup finals or IPL thrillers. Eden Gardens is the ultimate symbol of India\u2019s cricketing passion.\n\n\n\n4. Galle International stadium , Sri Lanka\u2014Scenic Serenity\n\n\n\nGalle is no doubt one of the loveliest of cricket grounds. On one side is the Indian Ocean, and on the other is the old Dutch fort. It is like the ideal image. Galle can be considered as one of the symbols of strength and the tough spirit of Sri Lanka after the 2004 tsunami. Muttiah Muralidharan, who was a legend when it comes to spinners, adored playing here due to the quality of pitches that were there for spinners. Galle is just the blend of history, unmatched natural beauty, and round-the-clock cricket, which makes it a unique destination.\n\n\n\n5. The Oval, London\u2014The Birthplace of English cricket\n\n\n\nEnglish cricket since 1845 has centered on The Oval in London. It hosted the very first test match ever to be played in England way back in 1880 and then had itself witnessed the very first Ashes series in 1882. The ground has a Test match that determines the end of a season, and therefore moments of decision in a series are regularly witnessed there. \n\n\n\nRack your brains and think of the record-breaking score of 364 by Len Hutton or the exploits of Kevin Pietersen in the 2005 Ashes, and you will know how this arena combines historicity and high tensions. The Oval is one of the most appreciated stadiums in sports because of its prime historical value and classical beauty.\n\n\n\n6. Wankhede stadium , Mumbaii\u2014Modern-Da Cricket temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall in size but big on\u00a0emotion, Wankhede is where India\u2019s cricketing dreams have soared. The most unforgettable moment came in 2011, when MS Dohni\u2019s team won India the World Cup on home\u00a0soil. It is also where Sachin Tendulkar bid farewell to international cricket in 2013. During IPL seasons Wankhede transforms into a sea of blue for the Mumbai Indians, making it one of the loudest and most passionate stadiums in the game.\n\n\n\n7. Newlands, Cape Town\u2014Cricket under Table mountain\n\n\n\nWith the stunning backdrop of Table Mountain, Newlands is one of the most picturesque modest cricket grounds in the world. Built in 1888, it offers a mix of natural beauty and challenging cricketing conditions. Early seam movement and later batting ease make for exciting contests. South African greats like Jacques Kallis and Allan Donald\u00a0 have make their  mark here and the venue\u2019s passionate fans add to its charm\n\n\n\n8. Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), Australia\u2014tradition and celebration\n\n\n\nSydney Cricket Ground (SCG) is located in Sydney; it has been standing since 1848, and it is known because of its history and holiday atmosphere. The ground is even more special with the Members Pavilion, the New Year\u2019s Test, and the pink ball test in aid of the McGrath Foundation. It is where Australian cricketing legends have thrilled, and supporters combine facts with jokes to make an unrivaled atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThese grounds are not playing fields, and they are living memories of the history of the game of cricket. Each ground has a history, preserves the traditions, and determines the future of a sport. Whether it was the time-tested exquisiteness of Lord\u2019s, the sizzling hot atmosphere in Eden Gardens, or the striking beauty of Galle, by entering this ground, it is like entering the soul of cricket.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe unfolding narrative of the South Africa tour of Australia in 2025 has taken a significant turn with Australia\u2019s key player, Owen, sidelined due to a concussion. This development presents a considerable challenge for the Australian squad as they prepare for the third T20I scheduled for August 16. South Africa approached this fixture with evident momentum, having secured victory in the last match and now aiming for a historic series win on Australian soil.\n\n\n\nFor Australia, the stakes could be higher. The team faces mounting pressure to recover from recent setbacks and sustain their hopes within the series. The venue, renowned for its high-scoring encounters and dynamic crowd atmosphere, further amplifies the intensity and unpredictability of the contest.\n\n\n\nThis match represents more than a routine T20 fixture. It stands as a robust examination of each side\u2019s strategic depth, psychological resilience, and ability to adapt under considerable pressure. Fans can anticipate both tactical and high-caliber performances as these two prominent cricketing nations fight for supremacy.\n\n\n\n3 big injuries derail the Australia\u2019s plan\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s white-ball campaign against South Africa has encountered significant setbacks ahead of the pivotal third T20I. The most substantial loss is that of all-rounder Mitch Owen, who has been ruled out for the remainder of the series due to a concussion sustained after being struck on the helmet by a delivery from Kagiso Rabada in the second T20I. Owen\u2019s absence leaves a notable void in both the middle order and the team\u2019s all-round options.\n\n\n\nCompounding these challenges, Matt Short remains sidelined with a lingering side strain initially sustained during the West Indies series, and fast bowler Lance Morris has been withdrawn due to lower back soreness, requiring further assessment in Perth. These enforced omissions will test Australia\u2019s squad depth considerably and place considerable responsibility on the incoming replacements during this critical phase of the series.\n\n\n\nSeries standing and player forms\n\n\n\nSouth Africa enters the third T20I with significant momentum, having secured the series by 1-1 and demonstrated notable proficiency in both batting and bowling.Brevis and Stubbs\u2019 composed presence in the middle overs has stabilized the South African innings, and all-round bowling efforts will give them confidence to win the series.\n\n\n\nConversely, Australia\u2019s campaign has been marked by inconsistency. While individual performances from Green, Tim David, and Josh Hazlewood have offered promise, these moments have not translated into sustained team success. The match will take place at a venue favorable to batters, characterized by a true pitch and a quick outfield, factors that commonly contribute to high-scoring contests. Statistical trends indicate a slight advantage for teams batting second, thus emphasizing the strategic importance of the toss.\n\n\n\nBoth sides will need to adapt quickly to the conditions, balancing aggressive batting with disciplined bowling. Although Australia retains the benefits of home conditions and crowd support, capitalizing on these advantages will require a more consistent and cohesive team effort to challenge the well-settled South African side.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Winning Edge vs Australia\u2019s Fightback Blueprint\n\n\n\nWith momentum clearly favoring South Africa, the visiting side approaches the final T20I with the prospect of achieving a historic series sweep in Australia. Their batting depth, illustrated by Rickelton\u2019s aggressive starts and Stubbs\u2019s composed finishing, has consistently disrupted Australian strategies. Meanwhile, the South African bowling attack led by Rabada and Ngidi has significantly limited scoring opportunities, applying relentless pressure throughout.\n\n\n\nThat said, Australia retains a chance to alter the series narrative. Their pathway to recovery necessitates proactive intent from the top order. The acquisition of early wickets with the new ball and heightened fielding standards to restrict boundaries. Strategic adjustments such as employing a pinch-hitter during the powerplay or rotating bowlers to unsettle the opposition may help in reclaiming momentum.\n\n\n\nNotably, the contest\u2019s pivotal phase likely resides in the middle overs. Should Australia manage to slow South Africa\u2019s scoring and preserve wickets for a late-innings surge, they could feasibly overturn the deficit. In the series decider, the hosts are expected to adopt a bold, committed approach in pursuit of victory.\n\n\n\n\n",

His aggression stems from within, not from talk\u2014he\u2019s described how earlier sledging distracted him, whereas now he lets the ball communicate.\n\n\n\nSo is the aura partly built by narrative? Yes\u2014but it\u2019s earned through consistency and performance.\n\n\n\nFan Culture: Reacting to the Myth\n\n\n\nX users have crafted something close to a cult following around Bumrah:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf Bumrah has a million fans, then I\u2019m one of them\u2026 Bumrah is my religion.\u201d\u201cBumrah is in the league of legends\u2026 No doubt batters fear him.\u201d \u201cBatsmen would not look as bad when they fall to Bumrah.\u201d\u2014a sharp observation from a fan referencing his psychological edge.\n\n\n\n\nThese posts reflect not only show adoration, but belief in Bumrah\u2019s ability to unnerve even the best.\n\n\n\nWhen \u2018Aura\u2019 Hits Reality\n\n\n\nDuring a firing exchange with young Aussie Sam Konstas, Jasprit Bumrah\u2019s body language and aggression were spotlighted.

The media may magnify it, fans may mythologize it, but at its core lies a bowler who repeatedly delivers in the toughest moments, against the best opposition. \n\n\n\nWhether opponents call it fear, respect, or just the weight of expectation, Jasprit Bumrah\u2019s presence forces batsmen to adjust their game before a ball is even bowled. And in elite sport, where the mental battle is half the war, that psychological edge is as lethal as the yorker he hides in his sleeve.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nSouth Africa delivered a commanding performance in Darwin, overwhelming Australia by a margin of 53 runs in the second T20I. Now, the series is levelled at 1\u20131, this match was notably defined by Dewald Brevis. His extraordinary innings of 125 not out from only 56 deliveries set both a record for South Africa. This astonishing inning also marked the highest individual T20I score recorded on Australian soil. Brevis\u2019 innings, punctuated by 12 fours and 8 sixes, propelled the Proteas to a formidable total of 218 for 7.\n\n\n\nAustralia, in response, struggled to establish momentum during their chase. Corbin Bosch spearheaded the South African bowling effort with figures of 3 for 20. He and Maphaka contributing significantly to the Australian side being dismissed for 165 in 17.4 overs. This decisive victory not only offset the disappointment of the opening match but also ensures an intriguing series decider in Cairns, with both teams keenly contesting for the series trophy.\n\n\n\nDewald Brevis smashed records in 2nd T20I against Australia\n\n\n\nDewald Brevis delivered an extraordinary T20I performance in Darwin, firmly establishing his place in cricketing history. At just 22 years old, he remained unbeaten on 125 from only 56 deliveries. A feat that not only rewrote South Africa\u2019s record books but also set a new standard for T20I batting on Australian soil. His innings was characterized by a remarkable combination of technical finesse and raw power, evidenced by 12 boundaries and 8 sixes.\n\n\n\nEntering the crease early after an initial setback, Brevis assumed control. Demonstrating an aggressive approach toward any bowler who missed his line or length. His strike rate of 223 exemplifies the sustained momentum he brought to the South African innings. Notably, this achievement marks him as the youngest South African to register a T20I hundred, further reinforcing his reputation as a prodigious talent.\n\n\n\nBrevis\u2019s contribution went beyond individual accolades. His performance was pivotal in securing South Africa\u2019s 53-run victory and revitalizing their campaign. In sum, his innings did not merely rescue his team, it illuminated the series.\n\n\n\nAussies\u2019 bowling suffers as SA posts 218 to chase\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s bowling attack faltered under pressure and South Africa cruised to 218 in 20 overs. Brevis\u2019s exuberant assault assured that every bowler had a stat, and with no bowler able to stem the run-scoring. Australia went into defensive fields and still leaked runs at over 10 per over. There were highlights in the form of a drop catch and a run-out that added some drama to a one-sided innings.\n\n\n\nDespite various attempts to change their pace and lengths, the bowlers did not have much success, especially towards the end. The Proteas were merciless in taking advantage of any mistakes, a poor shot by the batsman, a bad ball, a poorly designed field, or fielding mistakes. By the time the innings finished, it was apparent that Australia had been outplayed with the ball, which certainly presented them a challenge to win the chase.\n\n\n\nSouth African bowlers wrapped up the Aussies at 165\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s bowling attack delivered an impressively disciplined and impactful performance. They dismissed Australia for a modest 165 runs in only 17.4 overs and thereby securing a commanding 53-run victory in the second T20I in Darwin.\n\n\n\nDewald Brevis\u2019s remarkable and record-breaking innings had earlier set an imposing target, which the South African bowlers defended with both precision and strategic acumen. Corbin Bosch emerged as a key contributor, claiming three wickets for just 20 runs. While, Kwena Maphaka also made significant inroads, consistently applying pressure to the Australian middle order.\n\n\n\nAlthough Tim David offered some resistance with a rapid 50 from 24 balls and briefly partnered with Mitch Marsh, the momentum remained firmly with South Africa. Astute bowling changes, tight lines, and the ability to capitalize on Australian errors ensured that the hosts\u2019 chase never truly gained traction. With timely wickets at crucial junctures and a collective focus, South Africa\u2019s bowlers produced a comprehensive performance. Helped in decisively securing a victory that underscored their dominance in this match.\n\n\n\nSeries levelled at 1-1, all to play for in series decider\n\n\n\nThe emphatic victory brings the three-match T20I series to a 1 \u2013 1 draw, with the decider set for Cairns on August 16. South Africa\u2019s all-round performance from Dewald Brevis\u2019 blistering ton to their incisive bowling has been a turning point in this series. These factors given them not only momentum but also a psychological boost going into the final game.\n\n\n\nWith their back against the wall, Australia now need to regroup quickly and review their approach. Not only will they need to tighten their death bowling, their middle-order will also need to dig deep to come back stronger. The conditions in Cairns have properties favourable to batters when batting second with expected bounce and lots of outfield.\n\n\n\nWe may be in for a serious contest or a high-scoring thriller! Either way the stakes are high with both teams fighting for not just the Series, but bragging rights in what has been well contested T20I series.\n",

With government funding not limited by commercial expectations, women\u2019s teams have soared:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFans\u2019 observations note: \u201cInvestments made by the government tend to have more pronounced results in women\u2019s sports\u2026 because competition is lower.\u201c\n\n\n\nThis approach mirrors successes in women\u2019s volleyball and gymnastics in China\u2014areas where China leads globally despite limited international competition.\n\n\n\nWith men\u2019s cricket still nascent and lacking local role models, the women\u2019s game provides a clearer growth path\u2014offering results and engagement sooner.\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility and Talent Adoption\n\n\n\nGetting Chinese athletes into cricket has been easier via the women\u2019s side:\n\n\n\n\nParticipation in the Women\u2019s East Asia Cup (held in Hangzhou, May 2023) featured performances and excitement from players like China\u2019s Han Lili and Yuanyuan Cai\u2014potential pathway figures for domestic support.\n\n\n\nA former Hong Kong coach commented that \u201cChinese girls get into it easily\u2026 as long as you\u2019re a capable athlete, you can keep up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn male cricket, without access or interest focused in elite cricket-playing communities or expat circles, growth has been less organic.\n\n\n\nRole of Education and School-Level Campaigns\n\n\n\nThe ICC and local associations have promoted cricket through schools\u2014especially for girls:\n\n\n\n\nDuring China\u2019s Hangzhou Asian Games hosting, women\u2019s matches were well attended, and cricket was introduced at university campuses like Zhejiang University.\n\n\n\nWomen players and coaches were often chosen as early ambassadors precisely because their positivity helped build spectator interest quickly.\n\n\n\n\nEngagement Data Favors Women\u2019s Cricket\n\n\n\nEven though comparative numbers in China alone are scarce, global indicators reflect the phenomenon:\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023 ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup delivered 192 million global viewing hours\u2014a 44% increase vs. 2020\u2014and generated 1.39 billion video views.\n\n\n\nBrands recognize these trends: sports marketing executives note brands are now treating women\u2019s cricket as reach-driven media properties, not just feel-good assets.\n\n\n\n\nIn China\u2019s cricket ecosystem, women\u2019s engagement metrics exceeded expectations, especially during the Asian Games and East Asia Cup qualifiers.\n\n\n\nCultural Factors Favor Women Athletes\n\n\n\nIn China, women\u2019s success in sport is not new\u2014state support and social encouragement have long favored female representation:\n\n\n\n\nA cricket scholar observes, \u201cIn China, women\u2019s sport was historically prioritized in egalitarian skill development.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis cultural symmetry helps Chinese women\u2019s cricket evade the visibility gap faced by men\u2019s local sports.\n\n\n\n\nFan Behavior & Public Reaction\n\n\n\nAt the Hangzhou tournaments:\n\n\n\n\nStadiums were filled with enthusiastic Chinese spectators, even at matches between foreign teams like India vs. Sri Lanka in the women\u2019s finals.\n\n\n\nReports noted Chinese women\u2019s team members cheering loudly at Indian games\u2014and local media spotlighted their zest for cricket despite limited exposure.\n\n\n\n\nThis grassroots buzz is both genuine and unprecedented in Chinese cricket.\n\n\n\nSummary Table: Why Women\u2019s Cricket Outshines Men\u2019s in China\n\n\n\nFactorWomen\u2019s Cricket Men\u2019s Cricket Government support & visionHigh & focused on medal potentialLower and more experimentalCompetition levelEmerging equals categoriesDominated by expat/elite minorityParticipation accessibilitySchool/university pathways easierLimited structures at grassrootsPublic engagementCrowds at Asian Games; enthusiastic fansSparse attendance, niche interestSports culture alignmentWomen\u2019s sport valued nationallyCricket seen as foreign male sport\n\n\n\nFinal Take\n\n\n\nIn the broader cricketing world, women\u2019s teams often trail men\u2019s in popularity. But in China, the script flips. Here, women\u2019s cricket aligns with economic planning, education systems, and national sporting culture\u2014giving it an advantage that the men\u2019s side hasn\u2019t had time or structure to match.\n\n\n\nAs cricket grows in China\u2014and especially if it appears in the 2028 Olympics\u2014this foundation from the women\u2019s game may serve as the springboard to mainstream, even inspiring future generations of male cricketers to follow.\n\n\n\n\n",

This is the first time that they have been hosted in India in over 10 years, and people are so excited about it. There is, however, a twist; some of the games to be staged in Bengaluru are uncertain, and this is casting fear in the minds of the fans and cricket administrators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale cricket is gaining popularity everywhere in the world. Consequently, the ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025 is predicted to be huge in terms of viewership and revenues, which would have been anticipated by all. However, it has some problems when it comes to its preparation, such as calculating all the experiences, but also adapting to the weather, particularly in the southern part of the Indian territory.\n\n\n\nTournament Overview:\n\n\n\nThe opening match of the ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025 will be the game on the 30th of September to take place at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. India hosted the ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup twelve years ago in 2013, where Australia won the World Cup back then. The World Cup this year will consist of 8 teams to participate in it, which are India, Australia, Srilanka, England, Pakistan, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese eight countries have secured their place on the ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025 stage by playing in the ICC Women\u2019s Championship. \n\n\n\nIndia and Sri Lanka will be the first to play at the scheduled ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup in 2025 in Bengaluru on September 30. The second semifinal will be on October 30. In case Pakistan fails to reach the final match, the final match would be played on November 2 in Bengaluru; however, in case Pakistan reaches the final, the final would be played in the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. The ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025 will have ACA Barsapara cricket stadium in Guwahati, Holkar stadium in Indore, ACAVDCAParliamentary Stadium in Visakhapatnam, R Premadasa stadium, Colombo.\n\n\n\nCan the match be held successfully in Bangalore amidst rain and reconstruction issues?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are concerns about the successful holding of the match in Bengaluru. On one hand, the rain, on the other hand, the renovation work of the M. Chinnaswamy stadium, which was delayed due to this rain, several matches of the Group stage are scheduled to be held at this stadium, so the concerns are even higher.\n\n\n\nThe Karnataka State Government hasn\u2019t given permission yet to the Karnataka State Cricket Association to host the ICC Women\u2019s World Cup 2025. Karnataka State Cricket Association official said, \u201cWe\u2019ve written to the State Government and are awaiting a response. It\u2019s not as if they\u2019ve denied permission. If that were the policy, they wouldn\u2019t have allowed the Maharaja Cup in Mysuru. So, we\u2019re waiting. There is some more time for this, and we\u2019re going step by step,\u201d. \n\n\n\nLegacy, Leadership, and Growth are now at stake!\n\n\n\nThe goal of every World Cup is to establish legacies, not only to select winners. A few questions are arising: Will Australia maintain its supremacy in winning? Is India ready to win the ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025 in its territory, after a first-of-a-kind win? Never at home has India won the ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup. And will newcomer teams such as Pakistan and Bangladesh win? And answers to all questions will come\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis World Cup represents a transition from potential to performance, especially for India. It was 2017 when, for the last time, India made it to the finals of the ODI World Cup, but they lost to England by 9 runs. This will be full of strain, particularly when Bengaluru\u2019s unstable nature prompts the cancellation of opening games.\n\n\n\nHowever, the ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025 is certain to unfold history and excite dramas and greatness despite some challenges. The issue of the venue of cricket games being in Bengaluru is a burning issue to the cricket fraternity.Is India capable of becoming a contender for the crown as well as a host? Will the gods of the weather be lenient? The sporting world of cricket is following the issue of venue in Bengaluru closely.\n\n\n\nRegardless of any difficulties that might lie ahead, mark your calendars because the ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup 2025 is going to be history, drama, and nothing less than great.\n",

This piece unpacks the immediate issue in Hungary, traces the run of recent races, looks at the numbers, and tries to humanize what\u2019s happening behind the visor. Formula 1 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLewis Hamilton: I\u2019m absolutely useless and Ferrari need a new driver https://t.co/XBPj4kt8rc pic.twitter.com/GdkumRVtFS\u2014 The Independent (@Independent) August 2, 2025\n\n\n\n\nA weekend to forget: qualifying and race in Hungary\n\n\n\nHamilton\u2019s frustration boiled over after he failed to advance beyond Q2 at the Hungarian Grand Prix, describing his own performance as \u201cabsolutely useless\u201d and even suggesting in the heat of the moment that Ferrari might \u201cprobably need to change driver.\u201d That blunt assessment landed after Charles Leclerc took pole for the team while Hamilton limped out of qualifying in 12th and could not climb back through the order on Sunday, finishing outside the points in 12th (one lap down). Those results unthinkable not long ago were widely reported across the paddock and press. Formula 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statistics are stark: Hamilton\u2019s qualifying exit in Q2 and the 12th-place finish at the Hungaroring represent one of the more difficult weekends of his long career. Formula1\u2019s official race records show the finishing order and confirm Hamilton\u2019s position as 12th in the Hungarian Grand Prix classification.\u00a0Formula 1 \u00a0\n\n\n\nNot an isolated incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton\u2019s weekend-by-week consistency qualifying pace, tire management, and racecraft execution has been patchy, and it\u2019s compounded by occasionally uncooperative track characteristics and set-up choices that have not played to his strengths.\n\n\n\nLewis Hamilton\u2019s 2025 Ferrari Campaign (so far)\n\n\n\nMetric2025 \u2013 FerrariGrand Prix Entries13Average Race FinishApproximately 6.08thBest Finish4th (multiple races)Top-10 Finishes (GP)12 out of 13Wins (GP)0Podiums (GP)0Sprint Wins1Sprint Podiums2Driver Championship Position6th (109 points)\n\n\n\nSource: Formula 1\n\n\n\nWhy Is He Struggling? Three Key Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Setup & Car Balance: The current car demands precision. Without perfect balance, even elite drivers feel off. It seems Ferrari\u2019s setup window may lean more toward Leclerc\u2019s driving style.\n\n\n\n2. Confidence & Momentum: Racing is mental. Small missteps erode confidence, making it harder to push. Hamilton sounded disappointed with himself clearly, pressure is building.\n\n\n\n3. Team Synergy: Adapting to Ferrari\u2019s development path alongside Leclerc may have created slight disconnects in setup and feedback, impacting Hamilton\u2019s consistency.\n\n\n\nSource: Reuters\n\n\n\nRecent Race Snapshot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHungary GP: Out in Q2, finished P12 (one lap down). Formula 1\n\n\n\nPrevious Rounds: Across circuits like (for example) Barcelona and Monaco this season, Hamilton has experienced mixed results and has often finished behind both teammates and rival leaders an inconsistency that has shown up in timing screens and analyst write-ups. The trend leading into Hungary made the shock of his comments less surprising.\u00a0Motorsport\n\n\n\n\nPressure, Identity and Expectations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to reduce Hamilton\u2019s comment to a headline, but behind it sits the pressure of identity. Hamilton isn\u2019t a driver looking for validation, he\u2019s the benchmark for a generation but that very identity brings an intolerant standard. When he says \u201cuseless,\u201d he is expressing the shock of not meeting his internal metric, and that anguish resonates because fans expect greatness, not ordinary mistakes. The emotional honesty is rare in a media-trained sport and shows how much this season\u2019s struggles are getting under his skin.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhere does he go from here?\n\n\n\nTwo things can help \u2013 time and clarity. The short break after Hungary gives Hamilton space to reset, while Ferrari can fine-tune balance and aero during the summer shutdown. Focused testing, small qualifying gains, and consistent setups could rebuild confidence. Supporters like Toto Wolff remind everyone: form is cyclical, and upgrades can quickly change the game.\n\n\n\n\nToto Wolff on Lewis Hamilton: pic.twitter.com/thH1SyWnMQ\u2014 PlanetF1 (@Planet_F1) August 10, 2025\n\n\n\n\nA Champion\u2019s Low Point Can Be The Beginning of a Comeback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChampions are defined by how they respond, not by a single hard weekend. For seven-time world champion and one of the best drivers in Formula 1 history. Hamilton\u2019s words were uncomfortable, but they were also honest, a psychological reset that can lead to fierce, focused improvement. If Ferrari and Hamilton can translate that emotion into targeted technical solutions and regained self-belief, the story could flip fast. For now, the paddock watches, pundits speculate, and fans hope that the Hamilton we\u2019ve known ruthless, resilient, relentless will find his form again.\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about\u00a0\u201cISL Clubs Suspend Staff and Terminate Contracts Amid Ongoing ISL-AIFF Conflict and League Uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n",

(@ChennaiyinFC) August 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\nThe MRA Dispute and Governance Breakdown\n\n\n\nAt the core of this crisis is the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) between Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), the league\u2019s commercial operator, and the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The agreement\u2019s renewal is currently stalled due to ongoing legal proceedings, triggered partly by governance issues within the AIFF and an oral observation from the Supreme Court. Fox Sports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis legal limbo has created a vacuum in operational certainty. Without a signed MRA, clubs have no guarantee of participation fees, broadcast revenue, or sponsorship timelines. Eleven ISL clubs jointly urged the AIFF to immediately take the matter to the Supreme Court to avoid what they described as \u201cirreversible damage\u201d to Indian football. Indian Express\n\n\n\nFinancial Strain and Operational Fallout\n\n\n\nAt the center of the disruption is the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) between Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), the commercial operator of the ISL and the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The MRA renewal is effectively frozen after an oral observation from the Supreme Court and ongoing litigation tied to AIFF\u2019s constitution and governance. That legal limbo has prevented a firm agreement for the upcoming season, leaving operators, clubs and sponsors without clarity on the competition framework and commercial calendar. Fox Sports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClubs have explicitly linked their decisions to this uncertainty, without a confirmed season start date, guaranteed broadcast revenues, or validated participation agreements, many owners say continuing full operations is financially unsustainable. Eleven clubs have urged the AIFF to take the matter to the Supreme Court urgently to avoid \u201cirreversible damage\u201d. India Today\n\n\n\nImmediate operational and financial effects\n\n\n\nHalting salaries and contracts isn\u2019t just a symbolic gesture, it carries real, tangible consequences:\n\n\n\n\nPlayer and staff livelihoods:  Bengaluru FC has stopped first-team salary payments, affecting senior players, coaches, and support staff including several from the national team.\u00a0Al Jazeera\n\n\n\nClub operations: Odisha FC suspended all player and staff contracts and cited expiring participation agreements, sponsorship uncertainty and lack of training access as reasons for the decision. The club has said it will assist players seeking alternative opportunities.\u00a0Times of India\n\n\n\nCompetitive calendar: With the ISL on pause, ideas like hosting a Super Cup are being floated, but nothing can truly replace the stability and stature the league brings to Indian football. NDTV\n\n\n\n\nThese decisions have triggered a cash crunch with stadium upkeep, youth programs, and academy commitments still draining funds, but steady income from broadcasts and sponsors delayed or missing, clubs are being pushed into urgent cost-cutting measures.\n\n\n\nMore Than a Financial Crisis\n\n\n\nWhile the headlines focus on finances, the underlying issue is a systemic governance failure. Modern professional leagues are built on structured commercial agreements and predictable scheduling. The MRA dispute has disrupted the entire ecosystem, from media rights delivery to grassroots development planning.\n\n\n\nSponsorship and Broadcast Concerns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ISL\u2019s off-field business is hurting just as much as the football itself. Sponsors and broadcasters thrive on a clear, reliable schedule, but every extra week of uncertainty nudges them closer to reworking deals, cutting budgets, or walking away altogether. People in the industry fear that even if the season gets back on track, brands will be far more hesitant to commit, shrinking sponsorship deals. For clubs, that means running on leaner budgets, facing hard calls on keeping or signing star players, and fighting to keep the league\u2019s growth dreams alive. Fox Sports\n\n\n\nThe Human Element\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis crisis isn\u2019t just about governance, it\u2019s affecting lives. Players are left without income and unsure of their future, while support staff on modest wages face limited options. For fans, the blow is cultural; football is part of their identity, and delays, uncertainty, and disputes strain the bond with their clubs. Even with promises of support from some teams, trust has already taken a hit.\n\n\n\nPossible Outcomes (ISL)\n\n\n\nThe coming weeks will decide where the ISL goes from here. If the AIFF and FSDL can strike a Supreme Court\u2013approved deal, contracts could return, the season could be partially saved, and football might find its rhythm again though crammed schedules and changed sponsorships would still test everyone involved. If talks collapse, the Super Cup might keep players on the pitch, but it won\u2019t match the ISL\u2019s pull. Worse, a split with clubs pursuing their own paths could erase years of hard work. The only way forward is quick legal clarity, stronger governance, honest communication, smarter financial planning from clubs, and a united push from fans to protect the game they love.\n\n\n\nIn The End\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ISL\u2019s layoffs and contract suspensions reveal how fragile football becomes when governance falters. Beyond contracts, it\u2019s about livelihoods, dreams, and fan loyalty. Indian football\u2019s recovery now hinges on swift, decisive leadership.\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about\u00a0\u201cWhy Shreyas Iyer Has Been Overlooked in Tests Despite Strong Form.\u201d\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n",

Here\u2019s a breakdown of the stats, politics, fairness debate, and speculation on whether he could have turned the tide for India.\n\n\n\n1. Red-Ball Technique Vulnerabilities\n\n\n\n\nChief selector Ajit Agarkar openly stated there was simply \u201cno room in Test cricket for him\u201d, citing India\u2019s depth in the middle order\u2014even after Kohli and Rohit\u2019s retirements.\n\n\n\nFormer England spinner Monty Panesar echoed the selectors\u2019 doubts, saying Iyer\u2019s technique against swing and short\u2011ball is exploitable overseas.\n\n\n\nA Telegraph India insider noted that he\u2019s still regarded as more suited to home conditions and too aggressive for English whites.\n\n\n\n\n2. Ranji Focus & BCCI\u2019s Reaction\n\n\n\n\nShreyas skipped Ranji Trophy in 2023 due to a back injury but didn\u2019t get sympathy from the cricket board. His prolonged absence and IPL prioritisation cost him his central contract in 2023\u201324.\n\n\n\nHe regained it in April 2025 after IPL and White-Ball success, but the episode damaged trust with selectors.\n\n\n\n\n3. Selection Politics at Play\n\n\n\n\nFormer teammate Mohammed Kaif pointed to a double standard: Sai Sudharsan got a Test opportunity based on IPL pedigree, while Iyer\u2019s similar form in IPL wasn\u2019t rewarded.\n\n\n\nThe audience discussions highlight that Iyer may have clashed with BCCI politics\u2014his choice to skip Ranji and involvement with KKR preseason reportedly irked selectors.\n\n\n\nNotably, fans suggested players who didn\u2019t conform to expectations were treated harshly (\u201cplayers have zero incentive to play Ranji\u201d and \u201cShreyas messed with BCCI politics\u201d).\n\n\n\n\nForm vs. Fairness: Is the Test Snub Justified?\n\n\n\nPerformance Case for Iyer\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2024\u201325 domestic season, Shreyas scored 480+ runs at 68.57 in Ranji cricket, including notable centuries and leadership for Mumbai.\n\n\n\nHe led Punjab Kings to the IPL playoffs and hauled 514 runs in IPL 2025, plus topped run charts in the Champions Trophy, making him a strong white-ball asset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Suitability Concerns\n\n\n\n\nExperts like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ricky Ponting noted limited-overs form doesn\u2019t always translate to long-format resilience.\n\n\n\nFormer players Aakash Chopra and Robin Uthappa argued that Iyer still hasn\u2019t done enough in red-ball cricket to displace those already in Tests.\n\n\n\n\nIn short, while it\u2019s fair to pause Test ambitions over technique concerns, many fans argue that Iyer earned more opportunities than he got.\n\n\n\nWould Iyer Have Changed India\u2019s Recent Test Outcomes?\n\n\n\nWith India\u2019s loss to England fresh in memory, here\u2019s whether Iyer might have helped:\n\n\n\n\nHis ability to counterattack and shift momentum could have been crucial in middle-order collapses. Sehwag even suggested his aggression could have pressured England\u2019s batsmen differently\n\n\n\nBut Test challenges in England involve leaving balls, defensive technique under persistent swing, and mental patience, areas where selectors reportedly view Iyer as lacking.\n\n\n\n\nHe might not have saved a match alone\u2014but his presence could\u2019ve offered a different dimension to India\u2019s batting.\n\n\n\nVoices from the Fray\n\n\n\nFigureViewVirender SehwagCriticised omission; said Iyer\u2019s form and captaincy deserved Test consideration.Mohammed KaifCalled out double standards: Sai Sudharsan got a Test call post-IPL, Iyer didn\u2019t.Aakash Chopra / Robin UthappaSaid there was space for Iyer, but he needs more red-ball refinement.\n\n\n\nUnderlying Politics & the Broader Debate\n\n\n\n The Audience voiced frustration:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think him faking an injury may have pissed off the BCCI bosses.\u201d\u201cSelection is about following the system; maybe Iyer refused to play Ranji and that was seen as non-compliance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThis reflects an undercurrent: in Indian cricket, format commitment and public narrative matter as much as runs.\n\n\n\nFinal Take\n\n\n\nShreyas Iyer\u2019s red-ball career is a case of talent meeting structural resistance:\n\n\n\n\nHis white-ball success and domestic numbers earned attention.\n\n\n\nBut selectors and experts perceive weaknesses in his Test batting technique\u2014especially in swinging conditions.\n\n\n\nPolitics\u2014his absence from Ranji, perceived attitude, and lack of IPL-style PR\u2014perhaps compounded his exclusion.\n\n\n\nWhether it\u2019s unfair or not depends. If pure red-ball criteria apply, the decision aligns with cautious selection policy. But form-based merit and public sentiment suggest he deserved more testing.\n\n\n\n\nWould he have changed the result in England? Hard to say. But India\u2019s domino of middle-order failures perhaps felt different with an Shreyas in the mix\u2014a counter-puncher, not a conventional anchor.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nBengaluru is poised to become the epicenter of Indian domestic cricket later this month with the commencement of the Duleep Trophy 2025, which marks a return to the traditional zonal format for the nation\u2019s red-ball season. Scheduled from August 28 to September 15, six regional teams- North, South, East, West, Central, and North East. \n\n\n\nThey will compete in a high-stakes knockout tournament at the BCCI Centre of Excellence. This event is notable for bringing together established players alongside promising emerging talents, promising a competition rich in both nostalgia and competitive intensity.\n\n\n\nThe revised tournament structure is designed to generate early excitement. As the quarter-finals feature North versus East and Central versus North East, while the previous year\u2019s finalists, South and West, automatically advance to the semi-finals. The final, slated for September 11\u201315, will determine not only the champion of the zonal format but may also highlight prospective candidates for national selection ahead of a demanding Test schedule.\n\n\n\nA return to zonal rivalries\n\n\n\nThe 2025 Duleep Trophy signifies a notable return to the classic six-zone knockout format, evoking a sense of tradition long associated with Indian domestic cricket. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has opted to reinstate the original structure, comprising the North, South, East, West, Central, and North East Zones.\n\n\n\nThis decision follows several years marked by experimentation with alternative formats. All fixtures are set to take place at the BCCI Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru, reinforcing both the historical significance and the competitive nature of the tournament. For participating athletes, the zonal format transcends the realm of sport; it embodies the representation of regional cricketing heritage, fostering a heightened sense of responsibility and rivalry.\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of spectators, the tournament rekindles regional loyalties and pride, contributing to a vibrant and passionate atmosphere within the stadiums. The reintroduction of the knockout format heightens the stakes, minimizing the margin for error and intensifying the level of competition. As a result, the 2025 edition of the Duleep Trophy is poised to deliver a compelling and fiercely contested chapter in the annals of Indian domestic cricket.\n\n\n\nA glance of tournament\u2019s schedule\n\n\n\nTournament starts from August 28, with two quarter-finals; North Zone takes on East Zone on Ground 1, while Central Zone takes on North East Zone on Ground 2, at the Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. South Zone and West Zone, last year\u2019s finalists, both go directly into the semi-finals, scheduled to be played from September 4\u20137.\n\n\n\nSouth will play the winner of North v East Zone, while West meet the winner of Central v North East. The final running from September 11\u201315 promises us five days of high- quality red-ball cricket. The compact, knockout-only schedule brings an extra edge; every match becomes a knockout fixture, and there is no second chance.\n\n\n\nThe single-venue format also brings a consistency in pitch conditions, so the skill and tactics of the players will take precedence over travel fatigue. Fans should expect lots of long days of attritional cricket, traditional rivalries and emerging stars who might ride the wave into their respective domestic and international campaigns ahead.\n\n\n\nStar power on display\n\n\n\nThe Duleep Trophy this year features some of the biggest names in the sport of cricket in India, making it arguably one of the more anticipated editions in recent years. North Zone will be led by Indian test captain Shubman Gill after a productive tour to England. While Ishaan Kishan brings the dual threat of attacking flair and leadership to East Zone. For East Zone, we are expecting international star Mohammed Shami to put his world class bowling pedigree on full display.\n\n\n\nWest Zone has bats in the form of Shreyas Iyer, Jaiswal, Gaikwad and Sarfaraz Khan, any of whom can win a game single-handedly. On the other hand, South Zone mixes youth and consistency with Tilak Varma, Devdutt Padikkal and Narayan Jagadeesan. Even Central Zone might have a shot given Jurel captaining the side. Even, Yash Rathod and Harsh Dubey have been proven match winners.\n\n\n\nThese star individuals mean that the Duleep Trophy is no longer a domestic tournament; it\u2019s a star-studded event where fans get to watch direct competition with the best players in India sometimes lined up against their fellow international teammates.\n\n\n\nA big opportunity for young guns\n\n\n\nWhile marquee players typically dominate headlines, the Duleep Trophy has historically served as a critical proving ground for emerging talent, and the 2025 edition appears no different. North Zone\u2019s Anshul Kamboj, a right-arm pacer recognized for his propensity to secure early wickets, represents a potentially pivotal asset for his side. Meanwhile, East Zone\u2019s Abhimanyu Easwaran, though already seasoned, remains in pursuit of a consistent berth in the Indian national team and will be keen to make a significant impression.\n\n\n\nWest Zone\u2019s Sarfaraz Khan, despite a prolific domestic track record, is still striving to secure Test selection and will likely be highly motivated to accumulate substantial runs. South Zone\u2019s Tilak Varma comes under particular scrutiny, widely regarded as a prospective all-format player for the future.\n\n\n\nFor Central Zone, leg-spinner Danish Malewar introduces a valuable element of variety to the attack, whereas North East Zone will depend on their audacious batting talents in hopes of challenging more established teams. In a competition where a single outstanding performance can alter a team\u2019s trajectory, these individuals are afforded an invaluable opportunity to elevate their profiles and, potentially, expedite their progression toward national selection.\n",

      "content_full": "\nIn a recent episode of the Stick to Cricket podcast on being asked by Michael Vaughn about how to win in Australia, Ravi Shastri retorts about how you\u2019d want your spinners to play a containing role and provide some runs with the bat. This led me to think about how spinners are being used in modern cricket.\n\n\n\nTest cricket is not a static format of the game; everything has changed about the contest between the batter and the bowler, and will keep changing. Batters are constantly trying to find new angles to push the ball between the fielders, and bowlers keep finding new ways to outsmart them and give away their wicket.\n\n\n\nPlayer roles are constantly evolving along with the game, depending on conditions or team composition, and the state of the game. For example, it was usually the standard in test cricket to have openers who could defend and leave well who would see off the new ball, but openers like Sehwag and Hayden took on a more disruptive approach, opting rather to smash the new ball to the boundary to wear it out.\n\n\n\nThe decline of the specialist spinners\n\n\n\nThe recent exclusion of Kuldeep Yadav from the India-England test series is an indication of the lack of faith bestowed on specialist spinners on tours in SENA countries. Gone are the days of India opting to play specialist spinners in foreign countries like Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh or R.Ashwin. With the rise of a successful crop of spin bowling all-rounders such as Jadeja, Washington Sundar, and Axar Patel, India have chosen to travel with players who can give them returns with both the bat and the ball.\n\n\n\nWhile bowlers like Kumble, Warne, and Greame Swann were seen as genuine wicket taking bowlers on SENA pitches, we now see 4 seamers being played alongside one spin bowling all-rounder who tries to hold runs while the seamer tries to poach away wickets.Teams seem to be trusting their pacers far more than spinners with trying to pick important wickets.\n\n\n\nOnly in sub-continent conditions do we see teams such as India, Srilanka and Bangladesh picking bonafide spinners for the sake of picking wickets. We often see SENA countries suffering on subcontinental tours due to a lack of wicket taking spinners at their disposal which has become more of a problem in recent years.\n\n\n\nKuldeep Yadav\u2019s exclusion and Washington Sundar being picked ahead of Ashwin on the last tour to Australia is an indication of how teams are looking at playing specialist spinners versus playing spin bowling all-rounders who can also add runs to the total. Being a specialist spinner is not being seen as a skill that can cement a player\u2019s place in the team on SENA tours anymore.\n\n\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\n\n\nNathan Lyon was dropped from the third Australia-West Indies test\n\n\n\nThe last few years in test cricket have proved to be extremely effective for pace bowlers due to a combination of factors such as the reinforced seam of the Kookaburra ball, result pitches due to the WTC, and the innovation of the wobble ball overtaking test cricket. Reduced batting averages against pace worldwide may have led to a loss of faith in spin bowling specialists who might take up more time setting up a batter and getting their wicket.\n\n\n\nLower batting averages means that teams want to strengthen their tails or lower orders so that they can have some bonus runs off their backs, the spinners naturally come under the chopping block. Perceived that they cannot pick wickets and only slow down the run rate, they\u2019ll have to score some runs to secure their place in the team.\n\n\n\nHow will this change team selection?\n\n\n\nThe great West Indies team of the 80s laid down a blueprint that to be a consistently successful test team, you have to have a platoon of high performing pace bowlers, today\u2019s subcontinental teams seem to be be thinking along similar lines but they must not do it at the expense of the specialist spinners that have brought them so much success over the years.\n\n\n\nThe dominance of Australia over the 90s and the early 2000s relied a lot of Warne while Murali sustained the fortunes of Srilankan test cricket over almost two decades. Specialist spinners have been the cornerstone of poaching wickets worldwide while ensuring that home conditions remains a fortress for successful teams.\n\n\n\nToday, with Nathan Lyon nearing the end of his career, Shoaib Bashir remains the last of the specialist spinners who is allowed to keep his place in the team while offering almost nothing with the bat. The fate of Shoaib Bashir and his career may be the destiny for specialist spinners in SENA conditions when it comes to contemporary test cricket.\n",

It\u2019s a logistical challenge for cricket infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nCricket demands flat land, well-maintained turf pitches, and large grounds.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, football thrives on smaller fields, lower setup costs, and can be played in tighter communities.\n\n\n\n\nSo while Guwahati may boast Assam Cricket Association Stadium, smaller towns in Mizoram or Arunachal lack basic cricketing infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was no academy near me,\u201d said a former youth cricketer from Meghalaya. \u201cIf I wanted to train seriously, I had to move to Guwahati or Kolkata. That wasn\u2019t always possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Cultural DNA: Football as a Way of Life\n\n\n\nFrom Shillong\u2019s packed stadiums to street matches in Aizawl, football isn\u2019t just a sport\u2014it\u2019s a pulse in the North-East.\n\n\n\n\nMizoram, Manipur, and Nagaland have deeply rooted football ecosystems, with state leagues, youth academies, and scouting networks.\n\n\n\nPlayers like Jeje Lalpekhlua, Jackichand Singh, and Udanta Singh inspired the next generation\u2014not Sachin or Dhoni.\n\n\n\n\nCricket, in contrast, feels imported. It lacks cultural resonance and generational nostalgia in many of these states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Unequal Infrastructure and BCCI Investment\n\n\n\nFor decades, cricket boards in India prioritized traditional powerhouses\u2014Mumbai, Karnataka, Delhi, Tamil Nadu.\n\n\n\n\nUntil recently, most North-East states didn\u2019t even compete in the Ranji Trophy.\n\n\n\nIn 2018\u201319, the BCCI finally included all North-East states in domestic competitions\u2014but many teams lacked home grounds, proper coaching, or match experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were sent to play against seasoned teams with no match experience ourselves,\u201d a Nagaland cricketer once told ESPNcricinfo. \u201cWe weren\u2019t just underdogs. We were underprepared.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n4. Lack of Role Models and Representation\n\n\n\nRepresentation matters. It creates belief.\n\n\n\n\nIndia has thousands of domestic cricketers, but only a handful from the North-East have cracked the top tier. The biggest name? Riyan Parag from Assam.\n\n\n\nOthers\u2014like Abu Nechim Ahmed or Rahul Hazarika\u2014show promise but haven\u2019t quite broken through to the national spotlight.\n\n\n\n\nThe result: fewer kids see themselves on TV in whites or IPL jerseys.\n\n\n\n5. The Cricket Industrial Complex\n\n\n\nCricket in India is often a privilege\u2014structured around:\n\n\n\n\nClub cricket,\n\n\n\nPrivate coaching,\n\n\n\nTravel to metro cities for exposure,\n\n\n\nAnd access to selectors or scouts.\n\n\n\n\nFor North-East players, breaking in means moving away\u2014socially, linguistically, financially. It\u2019s a harder ladder to climb, with fewer rungs available at home.\n\n\n\nSo Why Do Some Make It?\n\n\n\nWhen a Riyan Parag emerges, it\u2019s not just because he\u2019s talented. It\u2019s because:\n\n\n\n\nHe had access to elite coaching (his father played Ranji),\n\n\n\nHe was scouted early,\n\n\n\nHe had exposure in age-group cricket with Assam and India U19,\n\n\n\nAnd he got an early IPL chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nRiyan\u2019s story is the exception\u2014not the system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tide Is Slowly Turning\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s some hope:\n\n\n\n\nThe BCCI has launched infrastructure grants for North-East states.\n\n\n\nMore cricket academies are opening in Guwahati, Imphal, and Shillong.\n\n\n\nGirls\u2019 cricket is rising too\u2014especially in Assam and Meghalaya.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Mizoram\u2019s women\u2019s team upset established sides in domestic one-day tournaments.\n\n\n\n\nBut it will take time, patience, and investment in belief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat It All Comes Down To\n\n\n\nThe North-East doesn\u2019t lack sporting talent. It lacks equal footing in a cricketing system designed far from its hills.\n\n\n\nUntil cricket feels local, until it can be played on a school field in Kohima or a college ground in Imphal without feeling foreign, it will remain a borrowed sport. A game watched on TV. Not played in barefoot joy.\n\n\n\nAnd maybe, that\u2019s the real story\u2014not why the North-East doesn\u2019t produce cricketers, but how the game hasn\u2019t earned its place in the hearts of the people yet.\n",
      "excerpt": "<p>In a country where cricket is often called a religion, the North-East reads from a different book. While Virat Kohli\u2019s cover drives echo across the subcontinent, in the seven sisters and Sikkim, it\u2019s football that fills the air. The result? Players like Riyan Parag feel like rare exports, rather than the norm. But it isn\u2019t [&hellip;]</p>",

      "content_full": "\nThe 2025-26 season of club football is just setting off with a new generation of No.10s, ready to dominate in some of the biggest leagues of Europe. Clad in the legendary jersey number synonymous with originality, imagination and command, these five are not carrying the torch, but reforming the past. Teen prodigies to Gal\u00e1ctico arrivals, here are the five new No.10s to look out this season: Lamine Yamal (Barcelona), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (Real Madrid), Jamal Musiala (Bayern Munich), and Matheus Cunha (Manchester United).\n\n\n\nThe New No.10s\n\n\n\nTraditionally, the No.10 was the playmaker, the elegant link between midfield and attack. But in the tactical complexity of modern football, the role has evolved. Today\u2019s No.10 is not only a creative force but also a goal scorer, a press initiator, and a spatial manipulator. The following players embody these hybrid qualities, ready to dominate their respective leagues this season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLamine Yamal: Barcelona\u2019s Crown Jewel\n\n\n\n\nAge: 17\n\n\n\nPosition: Right Winger / Attacking Midfielder\n\n\n\nNew No.10 Debut: 2025-26 season\n\n\n\n2024\u201325 Stats (All Competitions):\n\n\n\n\n\n35 appearances\n\n\n\n9 goals\n\n\n\n16 assists\n\n\n\nNotable Achievement: Youngest-ever player to feature in a UEFA Champions League quarter-final\n\n\n\n\nThe transfer of the No.10 jersey, which is handed to Lamine Yamal at Barcelona, looks like a symbolic and a strategic step. Following Lionel Messi\u2019s departure and Ansu Fati\u2019s brief tenure, Yamal is the next representative of the number, which is the most sacred to Barca. However, this is not a matter of marketing, but it is based on merit. Yamal is already being compared to Messi and Ronaldinho due to his close control, left footed dribbling ability and ability to play a major role in small spaces. He is more of a wide playmaker and interior creator as demonstrated in the possession-heavy system that Flick uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCole Palmer: Chelsea\u2019s Unexpected Maestro\n\n\n\n\nAge: 23\n\n\n\nPosition: Attacking Midfielder / Right Wing\n\n\n\nNew No.10 Debut: 2025-26 season\n\n\n\n2024\u201325 Stats (All Competitions):\n\n\n\n\n\n52 appearances\n\n\n\n18 goals\n\n\n\n14 assists\n\n\n\nNotable Achievement: Scored 4 goals against Everton in April 2024\n\n\n\n\nCole Palmer is the most regular and imaginative attacker in Chelsea, filled with billion-pound talent. Having been signed by Manchester City in 2023, Palmer is a meteoric player with a fee of 42.5M. After Mykhailo Mudryk went on loan and Raheem Sterling was pushed into a rotation possibility, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca gave Palmer the No.10, which is a show of intent. Opta suggests that Palmer made 81 chances in the English Premier League last season, third most by a player. His languid style belies a razor-sharp footballing IQ. Palmer thrives between the lines, with his quick one-two and deceptive movement creating constant headaches for defenders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9: Real Madrid\u2019s Galactic Ten\n\n\n\n\nAge: 26\n\n\n\nPosition: Forward / Second Striker / No.10\n\n\n\nNew Club: Real Madrid (Transferred from PSG)\n\n\n\nNew No.10 Debut: 2025-26 season\n\n\n\n2024\u201325 Stats (All Competitions):\n\n\n\n\n\n59 appearances\n\n\n\n44 goals\n\n\n\n5 assists\n\n\n\nNotable Achievement: Ligue 1 Top Scorer for 6th consecutive season\n\n\n\n\nThe football world held its breath as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 finally joined Real Madrid in June 2025. To signal his intention, Los Blancos assigned him the No.10 jersey that featured stars as Luka Modri and Mesut Ozil. At Madrid, Mbapp\u00e9 will not be a pure winger anymore since his front three players are fluid. Rather, he is expected to be used as a second striker or a false No.9 behind Endrick or Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, mixing charisma with killer finishes in the final third.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJamal Musiala: Bayern\u2019s Creative Compass\n\n\n\n\nAge: 22\n\n\n\nPosition: Attacking Midfielder / Winger\n\n\n\nNew No.10 Debut: 2025-26 season\n\n\n\n2024\u201325 Stats (All Competitions):\n\n\n\n\n\n25 appearances\n\n\n\n12 goals\n\n\n\n4 assists\n\n\n\nNotable Achievement: Bundesliga Player of the Month \u2013 March 2025\n\n\n\n\nAfter the departure of Leroy San\u00e9 and Thomas M\u00fcller\u2019s fading influence, Jamal Musiala enters the legendary No.10 position at Bayern Munich. Known as Bambi because of the smoothness of his movement, Musiala combines German precision with English flair. Under the new manager, Vincent Kompany, Musiala is likely to play the pivotal role in a youthful, reconstituted Bayern. The 4-2-3-1 formation suits him, giving him license to roam and get involved with the forwards Kane and Gnabry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatheus Cunha: United\u2019s Wild Card No.10\n\n\n\n\nAge: 26\n\n\n\nPosition: Attacking Midfielder / Forward\n\n\n\nNew Club: Manchester United (Transferred from Wolves)\n\n\n\nNew No.10 Debut: 2025-26 season\n\n\n\n2024\u201325 Stats (All Competitons):\n\n\n\n\n\n36 appearances\n\n\n\n17 goals\n\n\n\n6 assists\n\n\n\nNotable Achievement: Scored in 3 consecutive matches against Top 6 clubs in 2025\n\n\n\n\nTo the great surprise of the summer transfer window, Matheus Cunha signed with Manchester United as one of Ruben Amorim\u2019s creative rebuild. Cunha also offers a touch of flair, aggression, and versatility in putting on the No.10 jersey, selected after Marcus Rashford was signed by Barcelona. Never a traditional playmaker, Cunha lives off transitional chaos. He has great skills of dropping deep, beating his marker, and initiating the attacks through his counterattack ability; this would make him perfect in a fast-paced Premier League environment.\n\n\n\nFinal Whistle: A New Era of No.10s\n\n\n\nFrom Barcelona\u2019s teenage hope to Madrid\u2019s superstar arrival, the 2025\u201326 season offers a masterclass in modern No.10 play. These players are not just jersey-bearers; they\u2019re system-changers and game-breakers. With a blend of youthful exuberance and elite experience, they represent the next wave of attacking excellence.\n\n\n\nAs the season unfolds, keep your eyes on these five. The future of football may just be stitched into their shirts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Recap Table\n\n\n\nPlayerClubAgeMatches Played (2024-25)2024\u201325 Goals2024\u201325 AssistsShirt No.Role TypeLamine YamalBarcelona173591610Wide PlaymakerCole PalmerChelsea2352181410Classic No.10Kylian Mbapp\u00e9Real Madrid265944510False Nine/Second StrikerJamal MusialaBayern Munich222512410Dribbling PlaymakerMatheus CunhaManchester United263617610Vertical Creator\n",

      "content_full": "\nNo one had any expectations from this young Indian team. But, they end up leveling up the series and awestruck the cricket world. This series has shown us everything from passion to patience, determination to grit, sledging to bravery. Not a single emotion was left in fans that they didn\u2019t experience during this series. This is the proof why test cricket still matters and is the pinnacle of the sport.\n\n\n\nDespite the widespread dominance of short format across the globe, test cricket remains the constant. T20Is and ODIs are the places you go when you want some change in your life. It gives you excitement, freshness, and a surge of dopamine, but it\u2019s temporary. When you need peace, joy, and adrenaline, things that make you feel alive and yourself. You come back to your roots, your home, and that is test cricket for the fans.\n\n\n\nThis series is filled with memorable and inspiring moments from both the sides. Moments that teach you a lot and are etched into your heart. Whether it\u2019s the bravery of Pant and Woakes, Gill\u2019s record-breaking performance, Stokes\u2019 turmoil, Siraj\u2019s passion, and Rahul\u2019s patience.\n\n\n\nThe Lords: From where the mood for the series was set\n\n\n\nBefore the latter stages of Day 3 in the third Test, the series notably lacked significant drama or intensity. This dynamic shifted rather abruptly during the final session. With the scores level, the England side appeared hesitant to engage with even a few overs, opting instead to delay proceedings. Zak Crawley, in particular, was observed intentionally wasting time, seemingly to avoid facing Jasprit Bumrah with the new ball.\n\n\n\nAfter multiple interruptions, Shubman Gill confronted Crawley, resulting in a charged verbal exchange. On the very next delivery, Crawley was struck on the glove and subsequently called for medical attention, further delaying the game. In response, Gill directed an impact player gesture toward the England dressing room, a befitting reply to Crawley\u2019s act.\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere at Lord\u2019s shifted dramatically; the tension was palpable, fueled not by the weather but by the escalating on-field conflict. From this incident onward, the stakes increased, national pride came to the forefront, and supporters on both sides became deeply invested emotionally.\n\n\n\nWhy Edgbaston belongs to Gill\n\n\n\nAt Edgbaston, Shubman Gill delivered a performance that will be remembered for ages. His first-innings 269, followed by a commanding 161 in the second, resulted in an extraordinary aggregate of 430 runs, the highest ever by an Indian in a single Test. This feat places him alongside Allan Border as only the second player in history to record scores of 150 or more in both innings of a Test match.\n\n\n\nGill\u2019s achievements are particularly noteworthy given the scrutiny he has faced regarding his temperament and suitability for overseas conditions. Despite criticism, ranging from his reserved demeanor to doubts about his adaptability. Gill responded with remarkable composure and determination. His batting in this Test not only shattered longstanding records but also fundamentally altered the trajectory of the series, firmly establishing his reputation on English soil.\n\n\n\nThe inspiring bravery act of Pant and Woakes\n\n\n\nRishabh Pant put together one of the most courageous knocks of the tour at Old Trafford. Pant, bravely fighting through a broken foot, hobbled out to the wicket, scoring a memorable 54. A spirited counter-punch to pull India back from the brink. He appeared to be in agony, but he ran singles, took on the short ball, and was a thorn in the English bowlers\u2019 side. This innings was not just about runs, but it was a demonstration of character. Pant\u2019s bravery under duress turned the match and earned him admiration from teammates, opponents, and spectators alike.\n\n\n\nChris Woakes\u2019 heroism in the final Test, striding out to bat after sustaining a dislocated shoulder and having his arm in a sling as England embarked on a thrilling chase. While he didn\u2019t face a ball, his statement was clear. \u201cNever thought about not going out there,\u201d he said after India won by six runs. Woakes also admitted to being \u201cstill gutted\u201d that he couldn\u2019t finish the job.\n\n\n\nCenturies and handshake drama at the Old Trafford\n\n\n\nAt Old Trafford, the dynamics extended far beyond the immediate match statistics. With just 15 overs remaining on the final day, Ben Stokes proposed a handshake, signaling his intention to conclude the game as a draw. Yet, Jadeja and Sundar declined, opting instead to pursue personal milestones by continuing their innings in pursuit of centuries.\n\n\n\nEngland, having accepted the inevitability of a draw, turned to part-time bowlers such as Harry Brook, which appeared to provoke further tension. Members of the English side engaged in on-field verbal exchanges with the Indian pair, questioning the rationale behind seeking individual achievements in what was, by all accounts, a settled match. The atmosphere grew increasingly charged, culminating in Stokes departing the field without the customary post-match handshake.\n\n\n\nAn otherwise unremarkable draw thus escalated into a contentious episode, heightening the competitiveness of the series and providing a dramatic prelude to the decisive encounter at The Oval.\n\n\n\nAkashdeep: From grief to glory\n\n\n\nAt Edgbaston, Akash Deep delivered a truly remarkable performance, securing ten wickets for 187 runs, an unprecedented achievement for an Indian bowler in England. Yet, the significance of this feat extends well beyond mere statistics. Akash\u2019s journey to this moment has been marked by profound adversity: the loss of both his father and brother within a few months, mounting family responsibilities, and the emotional weight of his sister\u2019s ongoing battle with cancer.\n\n\n\nIn this context, his accomplishment on the field becomes not just a professional milestone, but a deeply personal tribute. Dedicating his performance to his sister, Akash transformed his success into a gesture of resilience and solidarity. His rise from the challenges of domestic cricket to Test match heroics exemplifies perseverance, and his achievement at Edgbaston stands as both a breakthrough in his career and a poignant chapter in India\u2019s cricketing history.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe course of Indian football in 2015-2025 was ten years of change, fight, and strength. The Blue Tigers took a huge leap forward both on and off the pitch with iconic legends such as Sunil Chhetri defining its presence in a global context and a churning cycle of coaches wanting to establish consistency. With India on course to achieve its Vision 2047, this article provides a detailed decade-long retrospective analysis, looks at the performance, player development, coaching staff, infrastructure, rankings and future.\n\n\n\nA Brief History (2015-2025)\n\n\n\n2015-2019: Constantine\u2019s Pragmatism and the Rise of Chhetri\u2019s India\n\n\n\nStephen Constantine\u2019s second stint (2015\u20132019) brought a renewed focus on compact defending and rapid transitions. Under him, India:\n\n\n\n\nQualified for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup after eight years.\n\n\n\nAchieved a then-high FIFA Ranking of 96 in 2017.\n\n\n\nWon the 2017 Tri-Nation Series, the 2018 Intercontinental Cup, and finished runners-up in the 2018 SAFF Championship.\n\n\n\n\nSunil Chhetri was central to this rise, scoring freely against quality opponents and taking India to the cusp of Asia\u2019s top tier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019-2024: Stimac\u2019s Tenure and Tactically Challenging Times\n\n\n\nFormer Croatian World Cupper Igor \u0160timac replaced Constantine in May 2019. Promising a more progressive, possession-based style, \u0160timac introduced fresh faces like Anirudh Thapa, Sahal Abdul Samad, and Liston Colaco.\n\n\n\nNotable moments under \u0160timac:\n\n\n\n\n2021 SAFF Championship Title win.\n\n\n\nStruggles in the 2022 World Cup Qualifiers (third in group).\n\n\n\nDraws against Qatar (2021) and Afghanistan, reflecting both potential and inconsistency.\n\n\n\n\nStimac\u2019s tenure ended in 2024 after India failed to qualify for the 2024 AFC Asian Cup knockout stages, raising questions about tactical incoherence and squad management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023-2025: Marquez\u2019s Methodical Stability\n\n\n\nAs interim boss turned head coach, Manolo M\u00e1rquez, also manager of FC Goa, brought much-needed structure. While his stint was short-lived due to personal reasons, he:\n\n\n\n\nPromoted ISL talents like Nandhakumar Sekar and Parthib Gogoi.\n\n\n\nFocused on short-passing and pressing patterns.\n\n\n\nHelped India regain some attacking edge during the 2024 Hero Tri-Nation and friendlies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-Present: Khalid\u202fJamil, the Homegrown Leader for India\u2019s Next Chapter\n\n\n\nOn August 1,\u202f2025, the All-India Football Federation (AIFF) appointed Khalid\u202fAhmed Jamil as the head coach of India\u2019s senior men\u2019s national football team, a move that marked the first time in 13 years an Indian coach has taken charge full-time. Jamil becomes the first permanent Indian national team coach since Savio\u202fMedeira\u2019s tenure in 2011-12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouth and Philosophy\n\n\n\nJamil was born on April 21, 1977, in Kuwait City to Punjabi parents and began his playing career at Mahindra United in the year 1997, from where he was transferred to Air India and subsequently joined Mumbai FC. He was a combative midfielder and played 40 matches and scored 4 goals in international matches at the Indian national football team between 1998 and 2006 after which an injury ended his career in 2009.\n\n\n\nImmediately Jamil kicked-start his managerial career by being in-charge of Mumbai FC (2009-16). He became popular in terms of tactical pragmatism and the capability to develop talent locally. His greatest accomplishment was made in 2017 when he took his club Aizawl FC to an unprecedented I-League triumph and against all odds, a success that has been termed as one of the greatest underdog stories in the history of Indian football.\n\n\n\nHe maintained his regular influence in the Indian Super League (ISL); as an interim and then permanent head coach at NorthEast United FC where he was the sole Indian coach to take an ISL franchise to a playoffs spot, and subsequently at Jamshedpur FC where he became the first Indian coach to lead an ISL team to the semifinals and a Super Cup final in the 2024-25 season.\n\n\n\nSelection and Formation of Expectations\n\n\n\nThe AIFF increased the confidence in his domestic knowledge, beating Stephen Constantine, Stefan Tarkovic and others to the shortlist. The judgement was supported officially by the Technical Committee and the Executive Committee of the body and one of the reasons justifying the move was his acquaintance with several Indian players before other forthcoming competitions like the CAFA Nations Cup and the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers.\n\n\n\nJamil, aged 48, is AFC Pro License-certified and usually prefers the 4-2-3-1 formation with a focus on compact defence, quick counterattacks and nurturing Indians among the young talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Mandate\n\n\n\nJamil inherits a side ranked 133rd in the FIFA rankings, at a pivotal moment marked by inconsistent attacking output and recent coaching turnover. His key tasks would be:\n\n\n\n\nReviving India\u2019s goal-scoring, the national side struggled to find the net under the previous coach, scoring just five goals in eight matches and failing to score in their first three games of the latest campaign.\n\n\n\nInjecting tactical identity, drawing from his ISL playbook to build cohesion in transition and set-piece efficiency.\n\n\n\nBridging local player development with national performance, leveraging his history in club-level talent cultivation.\n\n\n\n\nWith domestic confidence restored, Jamil begins his tenure keen to rewrite India\u2019s football narrative; for a team at the crossroads, he represents continuity, cultural fit, and strategic clarity.\n\n\n\nThe Players: Pillars of the Past and Promise of the Future\n\n\n\nSunil Chhetri \u2013 he talisman of Indian football, retired in June 2024, only to return in January 2025 amidst India\u2019s striker crises. With a staggering 95 international goals in 155 appearances, Chhetri stands:\n\n\n\n\n3rd in all-time international goal scorers, only behind Cristiano Ronaldo (138) and Lionel Messi (112).\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s most-capped and highest-scoring player ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandesh Jhingan \u2013 The Defensive Wall\n\n\n\nCurrent captain and central defender Sandesh Jhingan is the team\u2019s backbone. A relentless presence in the backline, Jhingan has earned over 65 caps since his debut in 2015 and captains India with fierce commitment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerging Stars to Watch:\n\n\n\n\nJeakson Singh (CDM, East Bengal): India\u2019s new midfield anchor.\n\n\n\nVikram Pratap Singh (Winger, Mumbai City): Explosive in transition.\n\n\n\nRahim Ali (Forward, Chennaiyin FC): Steady target man with 5 international goals.\n\n\n\nParthib Gogoi (AM, NorthEast United): Technically gifted future playmaker.\n\n\n\n\nCoaching Carousel: Strategic Shifts\n\n\n\nCoachTenureStyleHighlightsStephen Constantine2015-2019Counterattacking2019 AFC Asian Cup QualificationIgor Stimac2019-2024Possession-based2021 SAFF Championship WinManolo M\u00e1rquez2023-2025Spanish pressing systemTri-Nation Series, 2024Khalid Jamil2025-PresentCompact & Flexible TacticsYet to Coach his Debut Game\n\n\n\nFIFA Rankings: A Rollercoaster Decade\n\n\n\nYearFIFA Rank2015166201796 (Peak)2019101202210620241172025133\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s current position at 133 (as of August 2025) reflects the growing competitiveness in Asia and frequent transitions in coaching and tactics.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure: Building the Foundations Amid Uncertainty\n\n\n\nSuper League Turmoil: ISL 2025\u201326 Season on Hold\n\n\n\nA major jolt to the ecosystem came in mid\u20112025, when the Indian Super League (ISL), the country\u2019s top-tier domestic competition, was officially placed on hold. The pause came due to unresolved negotiations between AIFF and its commercial partner Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) over the Master Rights Agreement (MRA), set to expire on December\u202f8, 2025.\n\n\n\nFSDL informed clubs that without contractual clarity post\u2011MRA expiry, it was unable to plan, organise or commercialise the 2025-26 season. AIFF confirmed that per a Supreme Court directive on April\u202f26, 2025, it was legally restrained from renewing the deal until a court verdict, leading to current uncertainty.\n\n\n\nThe delay triggered operational crises: eight ISL clubs collectively appealed to AIFF for clarity; Odisha FC suspended all player and staff contracts from August\u202f5,\u202f2025, citing lack of season certainty, sponsorship shortfalls, and facility disruptions. AIFF has scheduled a meeting with club representatives in New Delhi on August\u202f7, 2025, to resolve pending issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining & Talent Development Facilities\n\n\n\nDespite the league disruption, India has expanded its technical infrastructure in recent years:\n\n\n\n\nThe AIFF National Centre of Excellence in Kolkata (Rajarhat, New Town) was initiated in 2018 with FIFA and AFC support. The initial phase includes:\n\n\n\n\n\nA two-storey Technical Centre with classrooms and dressing rooms.\n\n\n\nFloodlit artificial and natural turf training fields.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s first rooftop pitchso far completed; later phases include a stadium, coaching/referee education facilities, medical and sports-science centers.\n\n\n\n\n\nState-of-the-art stadiums such as EKA Arena by TransStadia in Ahmedabad (capacity ~20,000) and Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram (50,000 seats, eco-friendly design, Olympic standard supporting infrastructure) serve as modern venues that meet FIFA\u2019s technical standards.\n\n\n\nEstablished venues like Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium (Kochi) and Fatorda Stadium (Margao) continue to host international matches, ISL and national-team fixtures, equipped with broadcast-quality lighting, hybrid pitches, and media facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrassroots & Women Football Development\n\n\n\nAIFF along with FIFA and Telangana Government announced the opening of the first FIFA Talent Academy for girls in Hyderabad in 2025, a move towards excelling in respect to Vision 2047. It offers elite training, residential, medical, and educational support all year round to girls belonging to the U-16 and boys to the age group of U-14 to reinforce national talent pipelines.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the terms of quality training are being opened by personal academies like the Odisha FC residential football centre and the Rajasthan United FC residential football centre. The latter launched a fully-fledged residential academy in Jaipur in July 2025, retrenching its local development aspirations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutlook\n\n\n\nFootball infrastructure in India has gradually improved with several training facilities, FIFA encouraged academies, and world class stadiums; however, the administrative backlogs are a threat of losing the drive. The ISL scandal reveals structural weakness and there is doubt about AIFF sustaining its own Vision\u202f2047 blueprint. Going ahead, it will be indispensable to create transparency around the superior competitions like the same amount of money is spent on the facilities.\n\n\n\nVision 2047: India\u2019s Long-Term Roadmap\n\n\n\nIn January 2023, AIFF launched Vision 2047, a strategic blueprint to make India a top 10 footballing nation in Asia by the 100th year of independence.\n\n\n\nKey Pillars:\n\n\n\n\n50,000 registered coaches by 2030.\n\n\n\nGrassroots engagement with 35 million school children.\n\n\n\nAt least 3,000 active professional players.\n\n\n\nBoosting women\u2019s football, futsal, and para-football.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonours and Tournament Performances (2015-2025)\n\n\n\nTournamentBest Result (2015-2025)AFC Asian CupGroup Stage (2019, 2023)SAFF ChampionshipWinners (2015, 2021)Intercontinental CupWinners (2018, 2023)Hero Tri-Nation SeriesWinners (2024)King\u2019s CupRunners-up (2019)\n\n\n\nWhile continental success has eluded India, regional dominance in the SAFF region remains intact.\n\n\n\nStatistical Overview\n\n\n\nTop Indian Goalscorers (All-Time):\n\n\n\n\nSunil Chhetri \u2013 95 Goals\n\n\n\nBhaichung Bhutia \u2013 42 Goals\n\n\n\nIM Vijayan \u2013 39 Goals\n\n\n\n\nMost Caps:\n\n\n\n\nSunil Chhetri \u2013 155 Caps\n\n\n\nBhaichung Bhutia \u2013 107 Caps\n\n\n\nIM Vijayan \u2013 88 Caps\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s 2025 Match Summary (So Far):\n\n\n\n\nIndia 3-0 Maldives (March)\n\n\n\nIndia 0-0 Bangladesh (March)\n\n\n\nIndia 0-2 Thailand (June)\n\n\n\nIndia 0-1 Hong Kong (June)\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Upcoming Matches in 2025:\n\n\n\n\nIndia vs Singapore (October)\n\n\n\nSingapore vs India (October)\n\n\n\nBangladesh vs India (November)\n\n\n\n\nProgressing In Future: Problems And Opportunities\n\n\n\nKey Challenges:\n\n\n\n\nSurplus goals not scored after Chhetri.\n\n\n\nTactical unpredictability caused by changes of coaches.\n\n\n\nFIFA ranking decline due to performances declines.\n\n\n\n\nSilver Linings:\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing popularity with the fans, particularly in Northeast and Kerala.\n\n\n\nISL / I-league Youth Development synergy.\n\n\n\nThe strategic roadmap of AIFF provides clarity at the institutional level.\n\n\n\n\nKicking Toward 2047: How Indian Football Is Rebuilding After a Tumultuous Decade?\n\n\n\nOver the past decade (2015-2025), Indian football has been made to undergo a precarious transitional process. Indian football has already taken its first leap with a new generation being produced through local leadership with the likes of Sunil Chhetri becoming a legend and achieving international standards, the next step is here to be taken. Nonetheless, such a jump will require strategic restraint, grassroot investment, and fan-based support. With the prospect of Vision 2047 being true, the next decade could transform the Indian footballing future at the international level.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe Indian football team approaches the CAFA Nations Cup 2025 at a time of deep uncertainty, grappling with tactical inconsistency, leadership transitions, and a worrying slide in global rankings. Morale in the camp feels fragile, and the structure on the pitch is often disjointed. Yet, this tournament offers more than just fixtures. It\u2019s a rare window to recalibrate, to test new systems, and to show that Indian football can hold its own beyond familiar South Asian borders. For players, coaches, and fans alike, it\u2019s a quiet but crucial chance to begin turning the page.\n\n\n\nRankings & Form on the Decline\n\n\n\nThere was a time when Indian football carried a certain optimism. Today, that seems like a distant memory. As of July 2025, the national team has slipped to 133rd in the FIFA rankings, its lowest in nearly a decade. This isn\u2019t just a number; it reflects a period of deepening cracks. A string of painful results, including a 0-2 defeat to Thailand and a shocking 0-1 loss to lower-ranked Hong Kong, spelled the end of Asian Cup hopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe past two years have yielded only one win in 16 matches and just five goals, statistics that speak volumes about both tactical confusion and attacking bluntness. The return of Sunil Chhetri, even after announcing retirement, brought a flicker of hope with a win over the Maldives. But even that felt fleeting, more like a farewell gift than a step forward.\n\n\n\nSource: IndianExpress\n\n\n\nOrganisational Instability & Tactical Uncertainty\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, things haven\u2019t looked any better. When Spanish coach Manolo M\u00e1rquez stepped in, many hoped his European pedigree would steady the ship. Instead, he walked away after just a handful of matches, his final being that dismal loss to Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the chaos that followed, the AIFF received over 170 coaching applications. Headlines briefly buzzed with names like Xavi and Guardiola, but they turned out to be false alarms. And in the midst of that revolving door, the team has had no chance to settle. No plan has lasted long enough to take root. No system has been allowed to breathe.\n\n\n\nSource: India Today, The Guardian\n\n\n\nWhy CAFA Nations Cup 2025 Matters Tactically\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s entry into the CAFA Nations Cup isn\u2019t just a new tournament; it\u2019s a deliberate shift. Moving beyond the comfort of SAFF opposition, the team now faces higher-ranked, technically sharp opponents like Iran, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. This is more than a test of courage; it\u2019s a proving ground for tactics. Can India finally commit to a functional system, whether a high-press 4-3-3 or a disciplined 4-2-3-1? Can they stay compact without collapsing, press without getting pulled apart, or hold possession with purpose? With Khalid Jamil now at the helm, the first Indian head coach in 13 years, the spotlight is on how we play, not just who we play.\n\n\n\nTechnical Weaknesses: Data-Driven Analysis\n\n\n\nUnder M\u00e1rquez\u2019s stewardship in 2025, India played four internationals yet netted only once, rarely turning possession into real danger. Against Hong Kong, Ashique Kuruniyan missed a golden chance set up perfectly by Liston Colaco, one of several key failures in the final third. On defense, structures collapsed under pressure: goalkeeper Vishal Kaith gave away a last-minute penalty that sealed defeat, exposing consistent breakdowns in transitions and pressing cohesion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatDetailsMatches Played (Nov 2023 \u2013 Jun 2025)16 matches, only 1 win, 5 goals scored2024 Calendar Year11 matches, 0 wins \u2013 first winless year in 10 yearsJune 2025 Results0-2 loss to Thailand (friendly), 0-1 loss to Hong Kong (qualifier)Winless Streak~12 matches, lasting nearly 495 days \u2013 one of the longest in history\n\n\n\nSource: India, Olympics, ESPN\n\n\n\nWhat CAFA Success Could Mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong CAFA results would do more than pad the win column; they could shift the team\u2019s trajectory. Under coach Jamil, who keenly understands Indian football\u2019s grassroots, CAFA could help solidify a system, integrate promising young talent, and deliver identity-driven football. Most importantly, it could rebuild faith among fans, especially in football-rich states, showing that performance is more than slogans; it\u2019s structure, clarity, and belief realized on the pitch.\n\n\n\nStructure of Tactical Focus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJamil is expected to prioritize disciplined build-up, moving away from random long balls and demand midfielders who can shield the defense, resist the press, and transition into attack cleanly. Defensively, tactical elements such as pressing triggers, zonal shape, and inverted full-backs need testing. Up front, roles must be clearly defined: who leads the line, who links play, and who executes under set-piece pressure? These questions are tactical litmus tests that CAFA can uniquely reveal.\n\n\n\nFans: Tactical Hope, Emotional Lift\n\n\n\nFans have endured years of frustration, yet loyalty remains unbroken, perhaps because true despair has never fully eclipsed hope. One supporter\u2019s words after the Hong Kong loss still resonate:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHope is the only thing left in these dark days.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAFA 2025 could transform that emotional weariness into tactical confidence. Not through rhetoric, but through discipline, structure, and execution, giving fans not just hope, but a team they can believe in again.\n\n\n\nWe wish our national team all the best for the CAFA Nations Cup 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about\u00a0\u201cTop 15 Summer Transfers in 2025-26 Club Football.\u201d\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n",

After a trophy-laden decade spell at Manchester City, the Belgian maestro opted for a new challenge under Antonio Conte. With Napoli missing creativity after Zieli\u0144ski\u2019s departure, KDB brings vision, experience, and a winning mentality. KDB is yet to make his debut for the new club.\n\n\n\n2. Luka Modri\u0107: Real Madrid \u2192 AC Milan\n\n\n\n\nTransfer Fee: Free Transfer\n\n\n\nAge: 40\n\n\n\n2024-25 Stats: 22 appearances, 2 goals, 3 assists\n\n\n\nContract: 1 year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 12 glittering years at Real Madrid, Luka Modri\u0107 has joined Serie A giants AC Milan.

A modern full-back with playmaker abilities, Trent\u2019s addition gives Madrid a terrifying right flank alongside Rodrygo. On 18 June 2025, Alexander-Arnold made his debut for Real Madrid in a group stage match against Al-Hilal at the FIFA Club World Cup, which resulted in a 1-1 draw.\n\n\n\n4.

Despite a rocky last season at United, Rashford\u2019s direct running and versatility attracted Bar\u00e7a\u2019s board. He will likely play as a left-winger under Hansi Flick\u2019s aggressive pressing system. Rashford made his debut against Vissel Kobe in a pre-season friendly match.\n\n\n\n5.

He\u2019s yet to make his debut for the new club.\n\n\n\n6.

Mikel Arteta sees him as the perfect fit for his dynamic system and expects him to lead the line with Gabriel Jesus rotating in. Viktor is yet to make his debut for the new club.\n\n\n\n7. Noni Madueke: Chelsea \u2192 Arsenal\n\n\n\n\nTransfer Fee: \u20ac45 million\n\n\n\nAge: 23\n\n\n\n2024-25 Stats: 36 apps, 7 goals, 4 assists\n\n\n\nContract: 5 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal\u2019s wing depth gets a boost with Madueke\u2019s surprise switch from rivals Chelsea. The pacey winger adds directness and creativity, likely rotating with Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard. Chelsea fans expressed mixed feelings, but Madueke cited \u201cambition and clarity\u201d at Arsenal as deciding factors. Noni is yet to make his debut for the new club.\n\n\n\n8. Luis D\u00edaz: Liverpool \u2192 Bayern Munich\n\n\n\n\nTransfer Fee: \u20ac60 million\n\n\n\nAge: 28\n\n\n\n2024-25 Stats: 42 apps, 12 goals, 7 assists\n\n\n\nContract: 4 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayern\u2019s left wing, left vulnerable after Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s departure, has been bolstered by Colombian speedster Luis D\u00edaz. Known for his flair and work rate, D\u00edaz will compete for a starting spot under Vincent Kompany. His Bundesliga debut is set for August 7 vs Tottenham in a pre-season friendly match.\n\n\n\n9. Victor Osimhen: Napoli \u2192 Galatasaray\n\n\n\n\nTransfer Fee: \u20ac50 million\n\n\n\nAge: 26\n\n\n\n2024-25 Stats: 32 apps, 19 goals\n\n\n\nContract: 4 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stunning move to Turkey sees Osimhen reunite with former coach Okan Buruk. Galatasaray, looking to make a mark in the UEFA Champions League, now boasts one of the deadliest strikers in Europe. Victor is yet to make his debut for the new club.\n\n\n\n10. Thomas M\u00fcller: Bayern Munich \u2192 Vancouver Whitecaps\n\n\n\n\nTransfer Fee: Free\n\n\n\nAge: 35\n\n\n\n2024-25 Stats: 29 apps, 4 goals, 9 assists\n\n\n\nContract: 1.5 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bundesliga legend heads west. Thomas M\u00fcller brings his \u201cRaumdeuter\u201d instincts to MLS with Vancouver Whitecaps. Though in the twilight of his career, M\u00fcller\u2019s leadership and intelligence could be transformative for a youthful Whitecaps side. Thomas is yet to make his debut for the new club.\n\n\n\n11. Son Heung-Min: Tottenham Hotspur \u2192 LAFC\n\n\n\n\nTransfer Fee: \u20ac20 million\n\n\n\nAge: 33\n\n\n\n2024-25 Stats: 38 apps, 17 goals, 9 assists\n\n\n\nContract: 2 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother blockbuster for MLS, as Son joins Carlos Vela at LAFC.

      "content_full": "\nYashasvi Jaiswal\u2019s standout performance set the tone as India edged past England by just 6 runs at The Oval, securing their narrowest Test win ever.\n\n\n\nBelieve, it\u2019s a small word, but the impact it has on a person\u2019s life is beyond words. Siraj believed in himself and delivered an inspiring performance. This performance will be etched in history and fans\u2019 hearts forever. This whole series is all about belief, grit, passion, and love for this beautiful format.\n\n\n\nIn the 56 minutes of breathtaking theatrics at the Oval, Siraj embodied belief, tearing through the England\u2019s tail. The moment Siraj bowled a yorker to Atkinson, the emotions ran high, and the players ran into each other and hugged. The Indian flag was waved in the stands, and a stunned audience at the Oval was witnessing history in the making.\n\n\n\nEmotions ran high in the stadium. Everyone has teary eyes, whether it was players or spectators. It wasn\u2019t a win; it was the statement that India\u2019s young brigade will keep the test cricket alive. This win is proof that no matter what happens in cricket, test cricket will always remain the pinnacle of the sport.\n\n\n\nSiraj\u2019s spell: A moment that froze time\n\n\n\nOut of a series with many thrilling passages, I would argue that nothing could come close to the unseated rawness of that last 56 minutes at The Oval. As England needed just seven runs with one wicket remaining, the pressure was staggering. By contrast, Mohammed Siraj existed in the fire. Often described as energetic and aggressive, there was the ball of the series, a perfect yorker ripped out Gus Atkinson\u2019s stumps, which sent Indian players into havoc mode.\n\n\n\nThis was a ball that every bowler dreams about, and every batter runs from in their nightmares. Siraj\u2019s valiant efforts of 5 for 104 in the context of pushing back expectations earlier in the match don\u2019t even begin to capture the reality of a cricketer. Someone who followed an instinctive belief, rhythm, and emotional fuel to bow under the most confined pressure. In that time, he was more than a fast bowler; he was India\u2019s heart.\n\n\n\nThe visuals of Siraj celebrating and his teammates running towards him will live long in cricketing folklore. That single ball didn\u2019t just win a Test match; it portrayed the raw, poetic beauty of Test cricket in a nutshell. Also, did poetic justice to Siraj. He was at the receiving end when an unlucky dismissal happened at Lord\u2019s, and now he rattled the stumps to make sure India won.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s fighting spirit, from collapse to comeback\n\n\n\nThis was not a match that India was supposed to win. Not when England were 301 for 3, Joe Root and Harry Brook well-set and just 73 runs away from victory. But Test cricket, just like life, tests the brave and relishes brutal outcomes. India would not blink. The collapse that then ensued for England was not random; it was forced, modelled by India\u2019s dogged spirit.\n\n\n\nEvery catch taken, every bowling change executed with zeal. Akash Deep contributed significantly, Prasidh Krishna maintained composure under immense pressure, and the fielders circled like eagles. This collective effort challenged what appeared to be an inevitable defeat. The context amplifies the achievement.\n\n\n\nIndia had previously lost momentum in the series, faced a series of injuries, navigated leadership changes, and contended with unfavorable playing conditions. Despite these setbacks, the team demonstrated tenacity and strategic acumen. This was not a display of dominance, but rather a testament to perseverance and adaptability under pressure. The narrative had shifted, from a side facing imminent defeat to one that accomplished one of the most remarkable comebacks in recent memory.\n\n\n\nCaptain Gill\u2019s calm in the storm\n\n\n\nShubman Gill, in his first full series as Test captain, managed to carry himself with a calm authority that exuded confidence throughout the group. It is not easy to lead a team in transition against a good England side in their backyard. But Gill\u2019s calls from field placements to bowling changes were insightful, timely, and brave. He read the game well and remained level-headed throughout, even while it felt like England was strolling toward victory.\n\n\n\n\u00a0More than a tactician, Gill was a calming presence. His form with the bat,754 runs including four centuries, represented his captaincy while setting the example for India\u2019s fighting spirit. What shone most was his body language, on point, unfazed, and quietly assertive.\n\n\n\nWhen Siraj came steaming in for the final over, it was Gill at slip, eyes wide, encouraging his bowler with little flicker of doubt. That same calm presence reflected into the team. In the post-match interview, he didn\u2019t talk about individual glory, but the team belief, and a process comment that spoke to both maturity and leadership vision. In every sense, a captain was born.\n\n\n\nTest Cricket is meant to be forever\n\n\n\nThe fifth Test at The Oval wasn\u2019t just any sporting contest \u2013 it was a love letter to Test cricket. In an age when T20 leagues acquire the media, hype, and attention that Test cricket could not hope to obtain, the fifth Test provided a timely reminder of the unique depth and drama Test cricket has to offer.\n\n\n\nOver five days of ebb and flow, both teams exchanged the momentum in thrilling passages of play. It was not adrenaline induced by big hits or flashing lights that created tension, but rather the slow build of strategy, resilience, and pressure. When the last wicket fell just six runs short of England, it was a moment that reminded fans why they fell in love with the format.\n\n\n\nNo artificial hype \u2013 just cricket. The match had heart, heritage, and high stakes. For youngsters who were watching Test cricket for the first time, this was a perfect starting point. For the Test purists, it was vindication. The Oval became a stage, and in that final 56 minutes, the oldest format of the game reminded us how it can still deliver the timeless magic.\n",

      "content_full": "\nJaiswal Beautiful century again brought the Oval to light as the Indian hopes kept flashing in the last Test match against England. The fifth and final test between India and England at the Oval has set the stage for a pulsating finish. Thanks to gripping Day 4, packed with momentum shifts, record milestones, emotional celebrations and dramatic rain delays. \n\n\n\nEngland ended Day 4 at 339/6, needing just 35 more runs to win the match and clinch the series 3-1. India, however, is three wickets away from forcing a series draw of 2-2. With bad light and heavy rain curtailing the final session, all eyes now turn to Day 5, which promises a classic Test Cricket\n\n\n\nJaiswal\u2019s Flawless Hundred Sparks India \u2018s Fightback\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s young batting sensation Yashasvi Jaiswal continues to write his own script\u00a0 in red ball cricket as he scored a stunning sixth Test century, his fourth against England, on Day 3 of the final test at the Oval. The 24-year-old opener bounced back from a poor first-innings performance to lead India\u2019s\u00a0 second innings fightback, bringing up his century in style with a flurry of boundaries.\n\n\n\nThe milestone came in the 51 st over and Jaiswal\u2019s celebration was equally expressive, removing his helmet, blowing kisses to the dressing room and making a heart gesture with his hands. In Indian Camp, including needed coach Gautham Gambhir, rose in applause, acknowledging yet another special knock from the in-form batter.\n\n\n\nIndia record breaking series\n\n\n\nJaiswal\u2019s ton was India\u2019s 12th century in the ongoing Anderson Tendulkar trophy, breaking their series set against the West Indies in 1978. This is now the third-highest total number of individual centuries in a test series by a team trailing only Australia and the West Indies, who hold the record with 21 in a 1955 series. This landmark showcases the incredible consistency and dominance of Indian batters\u00a0 throughout the five-match series.\n\n\n\nJaiswal special connection with England\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis knock further solidifies Jaiswal\u2019s growing\u00a0 reputation as a nemesis for England. A former English\u00a0 pacer on air remarked on his love affair with England countries, a fitting summary of Jaiswal\u2019 consistent excellence. Interestingly, 82 of his first 100 runs came from behind square, the most by any batter at the time of reaching a hundred, highlighting his mastery in placement and short selection.\n\n\n\nShubman Gill Misses Milestone\n\n\n\nWhile Jaiswal grabbed headlines, Shubman Gill fell short of etching his name into the record books. Needing just 21 runs to surpass Sunil Gavaskar\u2019s iconic tally of 774 runs in a\u00a0 test series , Gill dismissed\u00a0 LBW by Guns Atkinson for a duck right after lunch. He finishes the series with 754 runs, the second\u00a0 highest by an Indian in a single test series, underlining his consistent contribution throughout.\n\n\n\nSeries Drama and Emotions\n\n\n\nThe series has been a blend of high-quality cricket and heated exchanges. Jaiswal reportedly snapped twice at Karun Nair over fielding lapses. Meanwhile, Akash Deep was repeatedly involved in tense moments, adding spice to the already intense on-field rivalry.\n\n\n\nDay 5: A Grand finale Awaits\n\n\n\nWith just 35 runs needed and 4 wickets in hand, England Historic Chase. India, hungry for a fightback, needed three breakthroughs with Woakes injured and rain looming, the series finale hanging on a knife edge and a thrilling end to a classic Anderson-Tendulkar trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

From university grounds in Hangzhou to elite training in Sydney and from Beijing to Guangzhou, China is charting a slow but deliberate course toward becoming a cricket-playing nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Historical Snapshot\n\n\n\n\nCricket first appeared in China in the mid-1800s, largely through expatriate clubs like the original Shanghai Cricket Club, which hosted interport matches with Hong Kong and Singapore until 1948.\n\n\n\nAfter a long hiatus, cricket was revived in the 1990s, and in 2004, China became an ICC Affiliate Member, later upgraded to Associate in 2017.\n\n\n\nAmbitious goals were set: in 2006, the Chinese Cricket Association aimed for 20,000 players and 2,000 coaches by 2015, World Cup qualification by 2019, and Test status by 2020. However, those targets remain long shots.\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure & Grassroots Growth\n\n\n\n\nChina has only a few dedicated cricket venues:\n\nGuanggong Cricket Stadium in Guangzhou (12,000 capacity), built for the 2010 Asian Games and granted ICC certification for limited-overs internationals.\n\n\n\nZhejiang University of Technology Cricket Field in Hangzhou, opened in\u202f2021 for the 2022 Asian Games.\n\n\n\nYet access remains limited. According to player accounts, Beijing cricket still uses school fields with artificial wickets and competes with football and rugby for space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s Cricket Footprint Today\n\n\n\n\nAs of 2025, cricket revenue in China is projected at just US\u202f$9.4\u202fmillion, with slow future growth forecast (CAGR ~0.9% to 2029). The fan base is expected to reach around 23 million users, but penetration remains low (~1.6%).\n\n\n\nThe Chinese national teams finally made their T20I debuts in 2023, including a first win against Myanmar in T20 qualifiers\n\n\n\n\nOverseas Development: A Sydney Story\n\n\n\n\nIn a pivotal move in 2025, the Chinese Cricket Association signed a five-year partnership with Cricket NSW and Sydney Cricket Club.\n\n\n\nA group of around 50 Chinese players and coaches trained in Sydney\u2014utilizing elite facilities, receiving high-performance coaching and nutrition guidance, and participating in practice matches with club teams.\n\n\n\nThis program is tied to long-term ambitions of Olympic qualification (Los Angeles 2028) and competitiveness on the global stage.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Cricket Struggles to Grow\n\n\n\n\nCultural and historical disconnect: Cricket was not introduced through British colonial influence, unlike in South Asia. Popular choices remain basketball, table tennis, and football.\n\n\n\nAcademic pressure and lifestyle priorities: Young Chinese athletes are encouraged toward stable career paths; long-term amateur cricket lacks professional incentives.\n\n\n\nMedia & exposure gap: Cricket receives minimal broadcast coverage or media attention inside China, limiting visibility and awareness.\n\n\n\n\nWhere Cricket Lives Today\n\n\n\n\nCricket is largely sustained by expat communities in cities like Shanghai and Beijing. Clubs such as the Beijing Ducks CC and Shanghai Cricket Club play social and competitive cricket, often against regional expat teams.\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s cricket in the region\u2014particularly in Hong Kong\u2014has seen relatively stronger engagement from ethnic Chinese players than men\u2019s cricket.\n\n\n\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s game remains developmental, but strategic partnerships and rising interest show signs of change. The Sydney training hub and ICC-backed coaching initiatives\u2014including ACC-led courses\u2014are helping build expertise.\n\n\n\nIf cricket features in the 2028 Olympics, and if China fields competitive teams, it could ignite domestic interest. But realizing that requires sustained investment in youth programs, facilities, and coaching\u2014far beyond current levels.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: Cricket\u2019s Long Game in China\n\n\n\nCricket in China is not yet more than a curiosity\u2014but it\u2019s hard to ignore the seeds being planted. From historic Shanghai matches to modern training camps in Sydney, the sport is quietly laying roots. Whether China becomes a competitive Associate nation\u2014or even the next ICC wildcard\u2014depends on vision, patience, and long-term cultural embrace.\n\n\n\nThe journey is just beginning\u2014but the potential, rare as it may be, is real.\n",

Despite the limited number of fixtures, the history between the Black Caps and the Chevrons reveals a consistent dynamic: New\u202fZealand dominance in Test matches, Zimbabwe\u2019s home pressure, and a chance for Zimbabwe to restart its long-lost momentum in red-ball cricket.\n\n\n\nThe Series & Early Action\n\n\n\n\nThe two-Test series runs from July \u202f30 to August\u202f11, 2025, both played at Bulawayo\u2019s Queens Sports Club. New\u202fZealand leads the head-to-head record 11 wins to 0, with 6 draws. Zimbabwe has never beaten NZ in Tests.\n\n\n\nOn Day\u202f1 of the 1st Test, Zimbabwe won the toss and batted, reaching 42/3 by lunch as New\u202fZealand\u2019s strong seam attack\u2014including Matt Henry, Nathan Smith, and Will O\u2019Rourke\u2014bowled with control. New captain Mitchell Santner led the side in place of injured Tom Latham.\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Head-to-Head\n\n\n\nTotal TestsNZ WinsZIM WinsDrawsWin\u202f% (NZ)171106~64.7%\n\n\n\nZimbabwe have never beaten New\u202fZealand in Test cricket over 17 attempts spanning from 1992 to 2016. The last full Test series was in 2016, where NZ won both Tests emphatically at Bulawayo.\n\n\n\n\n2016 Series: New\u202fZealand won by innings &\u202f117 runs and 254 runs, with Ross Taylor scoring 364 runs, and Neil Wagner claiming 11 wickets. Zimbabwe had little answer.\n\n\n\n2012 Single Test: NZ won by an innings & 301 runs, which stands as Zimbabwe\u2019s heaviest ever Test defeat.\n\n\n\n\nWhy the Disparity?\n\n\n\nSeveral factors underpin New\u202fZealand\u2019s dominance:\n\n\n\n\nBowling Attack Quality: NZ\u2019s seamers historically outclass Zimbabwe\u2019s batting. In 2016, Wagner and Henry dismantled the home side. In 2025, they field a balanced attack including Matt Henry and debutant Matt Fisher.\n\n\n\nDepth & Experience: NZ boasts players like Santner, Conway, and Rachin Ravindra; Zimbabwe relies on emerging players including Ervine, Raza, Williams, and Curran.\n\n\n\nHome Conditions & Mental Edge: Zimbabwe has not won at Bulawayo since 2001, and the psychological burden of past defeats looms large.\n\n\n\n\n2025 Series: What to Watch\n\n\n\n\nNew Faces: NZ bring in Matt Fisher on debut and Nathan Smith for seam support. Clarke Santner captains. Zimbabwe may include returning veteran Brendan Taylor after his ban lifted on July\u202f25.\n\n\n\nVenue Stats: At Queens Sports Club, average 1st innings scores hover around 324, with higher 2nd innings totals around 384. The ground favors pacers early but softens later, allowing spin and batting revival. Higher totals have reached over 700.\n\n\n\n\nThis is Zimbabwe\u2019s first red-ball action since losing all four Tests at home earlier in 2025\u2014two against South Africa and two in the tri-series involving South Africa and New\u202fZealand.\n\n\n\nBigger Picture: What It Means for Zimbabwe\n\n\n\n\nA win in this series\u2014even a single Test\u2014is overdue: Zimbabwe has a paltry overall Test win percentage of ~11.5%, with only 14 wins in 122 Tests.\n\n\n\nHosting New\u202fZealand and South Africa marks their strongest home season yet\u2014a step toward reviving their Test reputation.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nNew\u202fZealand\u2019s historic dominance over Zimbabwe in Test cricket is rarely under threat\u201411 wins in 17 matches with no defeats is evidence enough. Yet, this 2025 series offers Zimbabwe a chance at redemption, boosted by a packed home schedule and the return of experienced players.\n\n\n\nFor New\u202fZealand, it\u2019s about giving opportunities to rising stars while maintaining discipline and consistency. For Zimbabwe, every run, wicket, and over is a chance to finally break the hoodoo at home.\n\n\n\nThis series may not make headlines globally\u2014but it matters deeply for both sides: one aiming to maintain its dominance, the other fighting to write its first Test victory over a rival\n",

The moment he stepped onto the ground, flashbacks of Lord\u2019s coming back into the mind. But this time, he came prepared and determined.\n\n\n\nTo give rest to the seamers, England captain Pope changed the bowling, and Jacob Bethell came in for his first over. Akashdeep\u2019s confidence was boosted the moment he saw an off-spinner, and that stroke he played set the tone for India.\n\n\n\nAkashdeep\u2019s maiden 50 bamboozled England\n\n\n\nNobody would have thought that Akashdeep would play like a hero, and Jaiswal to play a side role. On day 2, Jaiswal was playing his natural game, which is attacking, and Akashdeep was there to protect his wicket. But, on the morning of day 3, the scene is reversed.\n\n\n\nAkashdeep was playing like a proper batter, and not a night watchman. He went berserk from the first ball. He hit 12 fours in his outrageous knock of 66 runs. It shows that he has the ability to bat when needed. He played all the types of shots, which you expect only from a top-order or middle-order batter.\n\n\n\nHis 66-run knock gave India a perfect foundation to play all day and take the lead by 350+ runs. Deep\u2019s maturity and determination give freedom to Jaiswal and play his natural game. This is the 2nd fifty-plus score for India as a night watchman after 2011. Amit Mishra scored 84, that too against the same opposition and at the same venue.\n\n\n\nJaiswal Anchors Again: A Knock of Patience, Precision, and Purpose\n\n\n\nJaiswal continues to exhibit a level of composure and tactical awareness that belies his age. Entering the crease at a precarious juncture, the early collapse of the top order and a shift in momentum towards England. He demonstrated both technical proficiency and resilience. His approach was marked by an ability to rotate the strike efficiently and absorb pressure. He provided much-needed stability to the innings before gradually accelerating the scoring rate.\n\n\n\nPerhaps most noteworthy was his partnership-building with Akash Deep. Jaiswal\u2019s guidance was evident through measured communication, shot selection, and a confident presence at the crease. The qualities that not only reinforced the team\u2019s position during a critical phase. Consistent with his performances throughout the 2025 season, Jaiswal\u2019s innings were not characterized by extravagant stroke-play but by a methodical accumulation of runs and astute game management.\n\n\n\nSuch attributes cement his emerging status as the backbone of India\u2019s red-ball batting lineup. Jaiswal\u2019s ability to shepherd both established and inexperienced players evokes his incoming greatness. He scored his 6th test hundred, 4th against England, and 2nd of the series. His latest performance further solidifies his reputation as a reliable Test batsman, adept at navigating high-pressure situations with maturity and clarity.\n\n\n\nA historic partnership that broke the 22-year-old record\n\n\n\nThe spirited 107-run partnership not only frustrated the hosts but also swung the Test match in India\u2019s favour. It was the 18th hundred partnership of the series, the highest in a series. Surpassing the 17-hundred partnership in BGT 2003-04.\n\n\n\nDuring the last session of day 2, Jaiswal took charge as the aggressor, helping to fast-track the scoring, while Akash Deep sorted himself out at the other end. However, on the morning of day 3, the situation changed and roles were reversed.\n\n\n\nJaiswal began to rotate the strike, giving Akash Deep a fair few deliveries, clearly building trust in Akash Deep\u2019s ability and hopefully instilling confidence in him. The trust of the established batter allowed Akash Deep to find rhythm and stability at the crease. Once a few loose ones came along, he began taking his chances and looking more sure of himself.\n\n\n\nThroughout their partnership, which added just over 100 runs with the bat, the England bowlers appeared to lose energy. Therefore, the atmosphere of the match swung massively in India\u2019s favour. What looked to be a potential 250-run lead turned into a 350+ run lead; they were clearly on the back foot mentally. This fightback was not exactly textbook style. It has tactical flexibility, attacking approach, trust in a partner, and resilience.\n",

Only 64 overs were blowed\u00a0 and the conditions constantly interrupted the rhythm of the both teams . Despite the frequent delays England\u2019 s decision to bowl first under the grey skies paid off as reduced India to 153/ 6 . However Karun Nair\u2019s fighting knock brought much needed balance\u00a0 to visitors\n\n\n\nKarun Nair Returns with Grit and Grace:\n\n\n\nKarun Nair walked\u00a0 in under pressure with India struggling after a series of soft dismissals\u00a0 and a shocking run out of Captain Shubman Gill . Nair hasn\u2019t played\u00a0 a significant test innings since his unbeaten 303 against England\u00a0 in 2016 . The Expectations were low but\u00a0 the rose to the challenge with Composure .\n\n\n\n\u00a0He began cautiously , playing close to the body and showing excellent judgement outside off stump .\u00a0 His first few runs came slowly but he gradually built his innings with smart singles and the occasional boundary . When he reached 52* , It marked\u00a0 his first half century is nearly nine years a symbolic return for a player many had written off\n\n\n\nKey moments : The fifty That lifted India \u2018 s spirts\n\n\n\nNair\u2019s half century came with a neatly timed fick for two off Jacob Bethell . It was a personal milestone but a moment of collective relief for the Indian team . At 201/6, India crossed the 200 run mark and for the first time all day England\u2019s Blowers looked slightly frustrated .\u00a0 This Knock was full of quiet intensity .\u00a0 His four off Josh Tongue, a full toss punished through covers, showed that he wasn\u2019t just surviving but also ready to counter attack when needed . More importantly\u00a0 he don\u2019t\u00a0 lose focus after reaching\u00a0 his fifty\u00a0 a common trap for many returning batters\n\n\n\nSteady partnership with Sundar:\n\n\n\nWashington Sundar provided excellent support with clam 19* off 45 balls .\u00a0 The duo added\u00a0\u00a0 an unbeaten 51\u00a0 runs off 88 balls which was India\u2019s highest partnership\u00a0 of the day .\u00a0 They respected the conditions , played late and avoided risky shots . Their\u00a0 stand ensured that India didn\u2019t suffer another collapse before stumps . With the pitch expected\u00a0 to ease out on Day 2 and Chris woakes possibly\u00a0 out injured this partnership could turn into\u00a0 a game Defending\u00a0 one .\n\n\n\nNair\u2019s Mental strength shines:\n\n\n\nWhat stood out in Nair\u2019s innings was his ability to control nerves\u00a0 and ignore external noise . Being recalled after years with a triple century\u00a0 as the\u00a0 big score in his test career comes with pressure . But Nair was unbothered .\u00a0 His technique looked compact\u00a0 and his temperament belonged to a seasoned campaigner.\n\n\n\nWhat lies ahead:\n\n\n\n\u00a0At stumps India are 204/6 with Nair on 52* and Sundar on 19* . The immediate goal for the Indian camp will be to stretch this partnership past 100 and get closer to 300 . If the sun stays out and the pitch conditions ease , this must be the beginning of a strong India comeback in this decider\u00a0 of the Anderson Tendulkar trophy . Karun Nair\u2019s return might just turn into a redemption arc and for India It\u2019s the hope they needed after rain marred tension filled Day 1.\n\n\n\n\n",

We\u2019ll break down his coaching philosophy, tactical impact, career highlights, and what his appointment means for the Indian national team setup.\n\n\n\nEarly Career & Playing Foundation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKhalid Ahmed Jamil earned 40 caps and scored 4 goals for India between 1998 and 2006. A midfielder whose on-field career was cut short by injuries, Jamil retired in 2009 and immediately transitioned to coaching with Mumbai FC.

His training ethic was legendary: arriving hours early, preparing the pitch meticulously, and instilling discipline in players. That groundwork nurtured future Indian internationals like Jayesh Rane and Rahul Bheke.\n\n\n\nTactical lesson: form can follow structure even on a shoestring. Source: Khelo Now\n\n\n\nThe Aizawl Miracle: I\u2011League Champions (2016-17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Jamil joined newly promoted Aizawl FC in late 2016, relegation seemed certain. Instead, he led them to win the 2016-17 I\u2011League, finishing ahead of giants such as Mohun Bagan and East Bengal\u00a0 .\n\n\n\n\nAizawl scored just 24 goals in 18 games, but won 11 matches emphasizing one\u2011goal margins and defensive resilience.\n\n\n\nThe team became the first club from Northeast India to win a national title, creating an Aizawl \u201cLeicester City\u201d story.\n\n\n\n\nJamil\u2019s tactical approach: tight transitions, organized set\u2011pieces, and maximizing local talent.\n\n\n\nSource: Hindustan Times\n\n\n\nHigh\u2011Pressure Roles: Kolkata, NEUFC & ISL Breakthrough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Aizawl, he took charge of East Bengal (2017-18) and later Mohun Bagan (2018-19) in the I\u2011League. Though his East Bengal stint had ups and downs narrow wins, defensive lapses, and question over line\u2011ups he maintained tactical structure across a partisan environment.\n\n\n\nIn the Indian Super League, Jamil first joined NorthEast United as assistant in 2019-20 and then stepped in as interim head coach mid-season. The turnaround was dramatic:\n\n\n\n\n11\u2011match unbeaten streak, building on a 6\u2011win run in 11 games\n\n\n\nDelivered NEUFC\u2019s first-ever ISL playoff qualification as an Indian coach the first to do so.\n\n\n\n\nGurjinder Kumar noted:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWith Khalid as coach \u2026 we got more freedom \u2026 He knew strengths of players \u2026 set us up tactically \u2026 that took advantage of those strengths\u201d\u00a0 .\n\n\n\n\nEven without star signings, NEUFC beat teams like ATK Mohun Bagan and Mumbai City FC evidence that a well\u2011structured system can level elite opposition.\n\n\n\nSource: Indian Express, Olympics\n\n\n\nJamshedpur FC: Tactical Consistency & Youth Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2023 Jamshedpur FC appointed Jamil as head coach.

      "content_full": "\nEngland encountered a significant setback on the first day at The Oval, as seasoned all-rounder Chris Woakes was sidelined from bowling for the remainder of the Test due to a shoulder injury. At 36, Woakes appeared visibly in discomfort after a diving effort in the field during Day 1, subsequently refraining from further bowling and was seen with his right shoulder heavily strapped, clearly restricting his range of motion.\n\n\n\nThis incident arises at a particularly pivotal stage, with the series finely poised at 2-1. As India prepares for a potentially substantial second innings, the absence of Woakes from England\u2019s bowling lineup could exert a considerable influence on the outcome of the match.\n\n\n\nWoakes\u2019 importance in the playing XI\n\n\n\nWoakes has been a quiet yet solid part of England\u2019s red-ball plans, especially at home. His tight bowling in India\u2019s first innings created an early gap at The Oval, and his level of control, as well as his experience, are irreplaceable given the current limitations of the squad.\n\n\n\nHis absence now creates just three frontline seamers on the pitch for England: Josh Tongue, Atkinson, and Jamie Overton \u2013 all young and talented but with limited experience of Test cricket when together. Woakes has 61 Tests to his name and averages 25 with the ball in England. In combination, it makes him not only statistically the best seam-bowling all-rounder in the last decade but also reliable if a top seamer picked up an injury.\n\n\n\nConcerns about injuries are increasing in the England squad\n\n\n\nThe timing of Woakes\u2019 injury could not be worse, adding to a larger fitness crisis that has plagued England\u2019s red-ball plans. Stokes, the captain and inspirational figure of the team, has played the series as a specialist batter who bowled in crucial moments. He was unavailable for this test due to a shoulder injury. Archer also remains out due to a back injury, leaving his long-term red-ball future in doubt.\n\n\n\nIn this fifth Test at The Oval, England have had to rely on three primary seamers, Josh Tongue, Jamie Overton, and Atkinson, who have, despite promise, played fewer than ten Tests combined. Woakes, however, has more than sixty Tests of experience.\n\n\n\nSeries and Ashes implications\n\n\n\nThe absence of Woakes doesn\u2019t only impact the result of this Test match, it looms large for England as they prepare for their 2025\u201326 Ashes tour of Australia. With Stokes potentially restricted in his bowling role in the long term, Woakes was seen as a key senior figure among a rebuilding attack.\n\n\n\nHis versatility with the ball, skill in controlling the game in flat conditions, and worth in low-order batting all made him one of England\u2019s most bankable and versatile options for the Australian summer. If he has done a serious shoulder injury, then the selectors may contemplate going into an Ashes series with none of Archer, Woakes, or Stokes as fully fit bowling options.\n\n\n\nThat would leave England with an inexperienced pace attack, consisting of only young bowlers appealing for selection in tough and unfamiliar conditions. The absence of a player like Woakes greatly diminishes overall leadership and tactical coordination within much of England\u2019s bowling unit.\n\n\n\nBigger questions for England\n\n\n\nChris Woakes\u2019 recent injury, though it lacked dramatic visuals or the sort of on-field chaos that captures headlines, may well prove pivotal for England\u2019s summer campaign. Beneath the surface, the incident underscores a more systemic issue within the team. An overreliance on veteran players whose fitness records are, frankly, precarious, and a glaring absence of younger seam bowlers prepared to seamlessly take up the mantle.\n\n\n\nThe immediate problem is obvious: losing Woakes in a crucial series significantly complicates England\u2019s tactical options. Yet, the repercussions extend further, signaling deeper structural weaknesses as England faces the demanding Ashes tour ahead.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the current pace of attack seems to be held together less by strategic planning and more by a combination of patchwork solutions, optimism, and an urgent hope that experience alone can bridge the gaps. Such circumstances hardly foster confidence in the team\u2019s long-term resilience.\n",

      "content_full": "\nNot many names are respected and worshiped in the legends of Indian cricket like the Little Master, Sunil Gavaskar. Long before the present cricketing giants like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli were even in the picture, Gavaskar was already the original Indian batting legend that the words and deeds have created. With his indomitable spirit, unparalleled skill, and intentions, no matter how big the run was, to score and bring the matches home, Sunil Gavaskar wrote his legacy by being an indomitable batting powerhouse.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s delve into his records in the glorious tapestry of Indian Cricket:\n\n\n\nSunil Gavaskar stood out as the pillar of Indian Cricket: In the era of Fast Bowlers\n\n\n\nIt was 1971 when Gavaskar made his test debut against the formidable West Indies; he entered a world full of challenging surfaces and fierce fast bowlers. However, the young 22-year-old Gavaskar shocked the cricket world by setting a record of 774 runs in his very first series, that record was not only his victory but also a global remark. When overseas victory for India was rare, Gavaskar gave India cricket hope.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to a nail infection, Gavaskar missed his first test, but he made the winning runs in the second Test in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, scoring 65 and 67 not out, giving India their first-ever victory over the West Indies.  In that same series, he made his first test century in the third test.\n\n\n\nHe became the second player after Doug Walters to achieve a century and a double century in the same Test match. Until Shubman Gill did it again against England at Edgbaston in July 2025, he was the only Indian to accomplish this feat.\n\n\n\nOther records he made in this series:\n\n\n\n\nHe became the first Indian to reach 4 test centuries in one test series.\n\n\n\nThe second Indian to reach two centuries in a single Test after Vijay Hazare.\n\n\n\nThe third Indian to reach three consecutive centuries after Hazare and Polly Umrigar.\n\n\n\nSunil Gavaskar scored more than 700 runs in this series, and his 774 774 runs at 154.80 are still the most runs any batsman has ever scored in a debut series.\n\n\n\n\nThe Milestone of 10,000 runs!\n\n\n\nAnother of the many contributions that the cricketer is credited with is the milestone when Sunil Gavaskar became the first batsman to accumulate 10,000 runs in Tests. This enabled him to break this record, and this was what made him the man of such a consistent and devoted trait when cricket was not as batsmen-friendly as it is in the present. The 10,122 runs that he had scored at an average of 51.12 in 125 Test matches at the time were an incredible feat by their very nature, given the times.\n\n\n\nIt is also remarkable that this record was created at a time when not so many cricketers had scored even the 7000 runs score. Sunil Gavaskar not only set the world standard of excellence but also set the standard for Indian cricketers.\n\n\n\nThe Little Master: A Pioneer in Skills and Cognitive Strength \n\n\n\nSunil Gavaskar not only excelled by scoring runs, but also due to how he scored the runs. He stood proudly and calmly before the quickest bowlers the world had ever seen in the finest type of defence without the protection of a helmet, when broken arms and injured ribs were a frequent thing to many. He confronted personalities like Michael Holding to Dennis Lillee, and most of the time he won.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had a reputation for batting out innings, and the long game is often credited to him for slowing down the actions of the opponents. In spite of how it was mocked during his time, the evidence of his loyalty to the old way of bat and ball playing was his 36 not out in the epic 60-over ODI that Australia played against England in 1975, where the wickets were the key.\n\n\n\nList of Records & Achievements of Sunil Gavaskar:\n\n\n\n\nSunil Gavaskar became the first Test cricketer to have scored more than 10,000 runs.\n\n\n\nGavaskar was also the holder of the world test century record before Sachin Tendulkar broke his record in 2005..\n\n\n\nHe is the only debutant to have the highest runs in a series (774 runs).\n\n\n\nSunil Gavaskar is the most successful batter in the series against the West Indies.\n\n\n\nGavaskar is the only batsman to score 4 successive centuries in 2 venues- Wankhede Stadium and Port of Spain.\n\n\n\nLater in 1980, he was also one of the Wisden cricketers of the year.\n\n\n\nIn the year 1980 he received Padma Bhusan award.\n\n\n\n\nSunil Gavaskar was awarded the Padma Bhusan in 1980\n\n\n\nA Heritage that Encourages Generation After Generation\n\n\n\nNewcomers who are breaking his records are emerging, but still, Gavaskar is an inspiration. Gavaskar holds one of the longest-standing records, which was broken in July 2025 when India\u2019s young sensation Shubman Gill broke the record of Gavaskar and became the youngest Indian batsman to achieve 1500 test runs as captain. The aura that Sunil Gavaskar has gained and the respect it entails remain unaffected, although the records are intended to be further improved.\n\n\n\nHistory Made! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udee1@tatacapital proudly celebrates #TeamIndia skipper @ShubmanGill for his heroic feat of becoming the highest run-scoring Indian captain in a Test series! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffbP.S: He surpasses #SunilGavaskar who scored 732 runs against West Indies during 1978/79 series.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pKWumCz1UI\u2014 Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) July 31, 2025 \n\n\n\nAdditionally, Sunil Gavaskar is a brilliant, innovative batter who reshaped Indian cricket. He was a classy batsman capable of taking on the best opposition bowlers and provided the Indian fans with a role model. The name of Sunil Gavaskar has been written in the history of cricket because of the pride and the determination that he gave the Indian cricket and the milestones he accomplished.\n",

      "content_full": "\nAnother milestone is etched into KL Rahul\u2018s international career. He completed 9000 runs during the 4th test and became the 16th Indian cricketer to do so across formats. From the elegance and calm of a monk in tests to the finishing flair in white-ball formats, the journey was full of adaptability, resilience, and struggles.\n\n\n\nRahul\u2019s journey has been anything but a straight shot. He had injuries, got stuck in the bench-warmer zone due to self-doubt, and nobody could ever decide where he\u2019s supposed to bat. It\u2019s wild. Still, every single time life throws him a curveball, he tweaks his game.\n\n\n\nOpening in Tests? No problem. Holding it down in ODIs? Sure. Whacking finishes in T20s? He\u2019s got that too. The guy just refuses to crack under pressure. He\u2019s not always flashy, but he\u2019s quietly turned himself into one of the most rock-solid, dependable players India\u2019s got right now. People still doubt him, but he keeps showing up, doing his thing.\n\n\n\nFormat by format breakdown\n\n\n\nKL Rahul is a valuable player, as he has consistently played across formats and changed his game as needed. He began his international career in Tests and has developed his game into a significant piece of India\u2019s white-ball puzzle. More recently, Rahul has reaffirmed his worth in tests, where his temperament and technique shine under difficult situations.\n\n\n\nIn his pilot life, Rahul opened 109 pavilions, ran 3,768 runs, over 10 tons and closed his career with his average of 35.88. That is not an impressive number but he is fighting to improve on his game. His performances in the SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) in which he won the match can be considered high points.\n\n\n\nRahul has over 3,000 runs and seven centuries in ODIs. He tends to calm down the team during the middle overs and is also capable of seeing a chase off. He is a sure scorer as his batting average is comfortably in the high 40s. On top of it, his keeping-batting combination performed great in the 2023 World Cup.\n\n\n\nIn the T20Is, Rahul has got to have over 2,200 runs to his name and his strike rate is well over 135, which indicates how much he suits the format. Although the pace of T20 matches is rapid, his classical style remains evident, and this allows him to stage large innings as an opener.\n\n\n\nKnocks that shaped his journey\n\n\n\nWhen the same KL Rahul, smacked a composed century at the Sydney Cricket Ground on his Test debut in 2015, he showed the world that he belonged at the top level and had talent in abundance. One year on, in his ODI debut against Zimbabwe, he took his bat to 100 runs-a type of performance that was basically a blend of mix-and-match and an approach that confirmed that he was a winner across formats.\n\n\n\nPerhaps one of his best matches was at Lord in the year 2021. Rahul knuckled down to the tune of 129 and led India to remain on top and clinch a victory under pressure. That was surpassed by him in 2023, at Centurion, where he was the first Indian wicketkeeper ever to score a hundred in South Africa. \n\n\n\nHe also steered India to victory in the 2023 World Cup game against Australia, with a steady unbeaten knock of 97, making his habit of anchoring the middle order quite clear so early in his career. In order to conclude, his innings of 91 in only 56 balls in a T20I match against the West Indies in 2016 is evidence that he is capable of firing when the game is in need.\n\n\n\nCollectively, these performances exemplify Rahul\u2019s resilience and underline his significance in high-pressure scenarios for the Indian cricket team.\n\n\n\nResilience and Reinvention\n\n\n\nKL Rahul\u2019s international cricket career has had its challenges, including form, injuries, and public scrutiny. After being dropped from the Test format in 2019, he moved quickly to adjust and become a key player for India in white-ball cricket, settling down as a player in the ODI format in the middle order, as well as taking wickets, functions.\n\n\n\nIn the 2023 ODI World Cup, KL\u2019s plays made his contributions clear, especially a pivotal 97 against Australia, when India needed it. Later on, KL\u2019s 66 was the top score in the final, yet he faced a significant amount of criticism for his intent. Rahul chose to put that noise aside and move positively.\n\n\n\n\u00a0He reinvented his game in the 2024 IPL, where he demonstrated improvements in his strike rate and power-hitting. It will help him to secure his place in India\u2019s plans for the next World Cup. His career displays many of the characteristics of resilience and adaptability, with 9,000 runs. It required some mental fortitude and continued evolution for this elite game.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nIn the past couple of years, however, Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy coaches have been selecting an increasing number of so-called all-rounders. These players are able to bowl as well as bat and this is exactly what the teams require today: to have the ability to mix and match in the fast-paced versions of the game. This is since all-rounders introduce flexibility, balance and strategical depth and therefore have become indispensable.\n\n\n\nThe series has been dominated by flat, batting-friendly pitches where bowlers have had to exert themselves to their fullest extent and have tired themselves out. With Stokes, Archer, Carse, and Bumrah being ruled out of the last test match, it is quite evident how challenging this series has proved to be for fast bowlers.\n\n\n\nFrequent injuries and big workloads for the fast bowlers have led to selection trends forming in this series, which has affected both teams. As the series has progressed, the tails have grown shorter, with multiple all-rounders being opted for rather than specialist batters or bowlers.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s batting order extension\n\n\n\nAfter the failures of the lower order in the first test, India has sought to extend their batting order while maintaining their bowling options. This led to a lineup where they opted for three all-rounders for the next three tests, namely Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, and Nitish Kumar Reddy (who was replaced by Shardul Thakur in the fourth test due to an injury).\n\n\n\nIn doing so, India has sacrificed the spots of one specialist batter and one specialist bowler. In a test series where taking wickets has been extremely tough, fielding an extra bowler may have been a solution to relax Bumrah and Siraj\u2019s workload. Yet in conditions that firmly favor batting, extending the batting order offers more security to the top order and can rescue the team in case of top-order collapses.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth test, even with Rishabh Pant\u2019s injury, the Indian team had enough batting resources to bat the match into a draw, a scenario that may not have been possible without extending the batting order to include Jadeja and Sundar.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBowling Troubles\n\n\n\nKuldeep Yadav has missed out on the entire test series.\n\n\n\nExtending the batting order comes at a cost; while you are adding players who can add batting talent to the team, you are excluding out-and-out bowlers who can help you take 20 wickets and close out the game. Such has been the case with Kuldeep Yadav, the left-arm wristspinner from India.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhile he\u2019d add bowling depth to the team, playing three spinners in English conditions would always have been too radical an approach. Rather than add bowling depth to the team Gambhir and Gill sought to add more of a batting cushion by playing Nitish Reddy or Shardul Thakur. India also does not have a fourth fast bowling option available to them, as Arshdeep Singh is extremely new to the red ball setup, and no pacers other than Bumrah, Siraj, and Akash Deep have gotten favorable returns.\n\n\n\nWith India being unable to keep their fast bowlers fit over a long duration, India has gone with a more defensive strategy of adding more depth to their batting order with the inclusion of all-rounders such as Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur.\n\n\n\nShoaib Bashir\u2019s injury and Liam Dawson as his replacement\n\n\n\nEngland only had a solitary spinner in Shoaib Bashir. While their batting order was organically lengthened by the batting abilities of Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse, Bashir\u2019s replacement by Liam Dawson shortened England\u2019s tail further. The role of the spinner has been relegated to a holding bowler or a containment role who can add some batting to the tail.\n\n\n\nThe successive replacements of Dawson with Bashir and Dawson with Jacob Bethell have added more to the batting order, with them almost batting down to 10. England seems to have also employed India\u2019s approach of going with more all-rounders, given the batting-friendly conditions prevalent in the series.\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean for Test cricket?\n\n\n\nWhile all-rounders in test cricket are rare and very valuable, the core principle to winning test matches is by taking 20 wickets with enough runs in the bag to do so. Playing all-rounders in certain conditions may jeopardize this balance when a team may need a specialist batter to add big runs, while an all-rounder may not have that capability at all.\n\n\n\nConversely, a team needs a platoon of 4 specialist bowlers who need to be able to take 20 wickets in any given conditions for a team to consistently win test matches. Prioritizing the selection of all-rounders while adding bowling and batting variety to the team may sometimes lead to reducing the overall batting or bowling strength of a test side.\n",

Indian bowlers worked hard on flat wicket and Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah shared much of the load.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Fightback\n\n\n\nIndia played with a lot of spirit even though their first innings did not produce enough runs to demonstrate this fortitude. KL Rahul laid a good foundation with a dogged 90 before Shubman Gill (103), Washington Sundar (101), Ravindra Jadeja (107) showed brilliance of application and flair to get India out of hole in the second innings.\n\n\n\nIndia lost both their openers early in the powerplay after Chris Woakes made the initial breakthrough reducing the visitors to 0/2 in 0.5 overs but what came after that was one of the best rearguard acts in recent times. India took 143 overs to stage a remarkable rescue of the Test.\n\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Ben Stokes\n\n\n\nAlthough the match ended in a tie, Stokes took a stunning five-wicket haul in the first innings of the match and roughed up England to outplay their arch-rivals in their own backyard and that too in front of their home crowd which displayed his exemplary character when playing in a different continent.\n\n\n\nSeries Scorecard After 4 Tests:\n\n\n\n\n1st Test: England won by 5 wickets (Leeds)\n\n\n\n2nd Test: India won by 336 runs (Birmingham)\n\n\n\n3rd Test: England won by 22 runs (Lord\u2019s)\n\n\n\n4th Test: Match drawn (Manchester)\n\n\n\n\nSeries Status: England lead 2-1\n\n\n\n5th Test Preview: England vs India | Series Decider at The Oval\n\n\n\nVenue: Kennington Oval, LondonDates: July 31 \u2013 August 4, 2025Start Time: 10:00 AM GMT / 3:30 PM IST\n\n\n\nThe moment of truth has arrived. The fifth and final Test of the India-England series kicks off at The Oval, with the series tantalizingly poised at 2-1 in favor of England. For India, it\u2019s a must-win to level the series, while England have a chance to seal the series outright at home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s Squad Shake-Up: Youth over Experience\n\n\n\nAhead of the 5th Test, England have been forced to make wholesale changes due to injuries and form.\n\n\n\nKey Changes:\n\n\n\nOutInBen StokesJacob BethellJofra ArcherJamie OvertonLiam DawsonJosh TongueBrydon CarseGus Atkinson\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s Playing XI for the 5th Test (Confirmed):\n\n\n\n\nZak Crawley\n\n\n\nBen Duckett\n\n\n\nOllie Pope (C)\n\n\n\nJoe Root\n\n\n\nHarry Brook\n\n\n\nJacob Bethell\n\n\n\nJamie Smith (WK)\n\n\n\nChris Woakes\n\n\n\nGus Atkinson\n\n\n\nJamie Overton\n\n\n\nJosh Tongue\n\n\n\n\nWith Stokes out, Ollie Pope leads a young side.

The waves had to be turned up again as the boy of Fazilka in Punjab is now the youngest ever Test Captain of India, the 24-year-old batting sensation. As Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma approach the end of their careers, the contentious topic is whether Gill will become an all-format leader in the future. \n\n\n\nThe Rising Future Star: Shubman Gill\u2019s Journey from Fazilka to India\u2019s Test Captain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom growing up and playing cricket since the age of 3 to playing in foreign countries and becoming the first Indian batter to score 700 runs in a Test series played in SENA countries. His journey is nothing short of a reverie. He has been depicting his potential since his early days of playing cricket, and he has won consecutive BCCI junior cricketer of the year awards in 2014 and 2015, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis class, temperament, and hunger have been on view since he made headlines through his out-of-the-world performance in the U-19 World Cup 2018. Later, he gained double centuries in ODIs and Tests. He is already being equated to some of the best players of all time at a very young age in terms of ability.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at his stats:\n\n\n\nFORMATRUNSSTRIKERATEAVG100s50sODIs277599.659.0815TESTS261561.342.297T20s578139.330.413\n\n\n\nHis stats across various formats prove his potential in this game, and he currently trails Sir Don Bradman for the most runs in a captaincy debut with 722* runs in his first Test series as captain.\n\n\n\nHistoric company for Shubman Gill! \ud83d\udd25With 722* runs in his debut Test series as skipper, he now ranks just behind Sir Don Bradman for the most runs in a captaincy debut. \ud83d\udcaf#ENGvIND #ShubmanGill #TestCricket #Sportskeeda pic.twitter.com/GDJyOPV3oq\u2014 Sportskeeda (@Sportskeeda) July 27, 2025\n\n\n\nCould He Become the Next All-Format Skipper for India? : Capabilities and Experience in Leadership\n\n\n\nPreviously, he has shown his potential as T20 captain in India\u2019s 5 match T20 series against Zimbabwe in July 2024. And now he is showing his potential as Test Captain in this India vs England series. He was also the captain of Punjab in domestic cricket and has captained the India A team a couple of times, and his cool and calm nature has always shown us that he is capable of captaincy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision by BCCI and selectors in offering Shubman Gill the Test captaincy when India is already in a transition phase demonstrates how well they believe he is here for the long run. Since test cricket is the most difficult format, it\u2019s frequently thought of as a test for leadership abilities. Gill may soon be on his way to becoming an ODI and T20I permanent skipper if he can effectively handle this task.\n\n\n\nChallenges that could come in his way:\n\n\n\nMaking the switch to an all-format captain won\u2019t be easy. India is a country where cricket is like a religion, and every decision taken by its captains is closely watched. Shubman Gill has to look after a few things and learn them quickly. He has to make tactical and strategic choices under pressure, and along with his leadership duties, he has to focus on his batting. Furthermore, captaining across formats is a serious workload.\n\n\n\nTransitional Phase: Rise of new Superstars \n\n\n\nCurrently, Indian cricket is in a phase of transition with both of the most considerable pillars of Indian cricket, such as Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma to have already retired in Test and T20 formats. So, for now, India is looking for their replacement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe young talent is already being groomed with the availability of players such as Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, and Yashasvi Jaiswal. Gill is one of the best among them as a cricketer to put the team in a new era, not only as a batter. His selection as Test captain now offers him the ideal chance to develop his leadership style and to prepare himself as an all-format captain.\n\n\n\n\nIs he ready for the big duty?\n\n\n\nModern cricket can be achieved successfully by young leaders, despite experience. Other leaders like Kapil Dev, MS Dhoni, and Virat Kohli were leaders at comparatively young ages, and they have flourished. It is not age but the ability to be a team head, to motivate people, and to be capable of making the correct decision in critical cases.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Shubman Gill, he is still in the beginning stages of being the captain, and he already fulfills most of these criteria. If he keeps improving, and can make India win under pressure, and make tactical decisions, India might see him as the all-format captain. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s just a matter of time, is he ready for this big duty or not? Even though the answer is still unfolding but looking at the young Indian cricket team, one thing is clear: Indian cricket is in safe hands.\n",

The game was played to a draw 1-1 after extra time with each scoring goals through Mariona Caldentey and Alessia Russo but England kept a cold heart and lifted the trophy once again after beating Spain 3-1 in penalties.\n\n\n\nThe Back-to-Back Glory in England\n\n\n\nThe Lionesses under the management of Sarina Wiegman showed why they are champions of European football. In a pressure situation, it was England that emerged as the winner even though they were out gunned by Spain. They put up tough defense, made quick counterattacks and were mentally tough during the penalty shoot-out to win their championship.\n\n\n\nEngland was the second country to win two consecutive European cups in the UEFA Women after Germany and this victory made them as an emerging giant in the sport of women.\n\n\n\nFinal Scoreline:\n\n\n\nTeamFT ScorePenaltiesEngland13Spain11\n\n\n\nGoalscorers:\n\n\n\n\nSpain: Mariona Caldentey (25\u2019)\n\n\n\nEngland: Alessia Russo (57\u2019)\n\n\n\n\nMatch Statistics\n\n\n\nCategoryEnglandSpainShots822Shots on Target55Possession35%65%Passes419764Pass Accuracy74%85%Fouls1610Yellow Cards30Red Cards00Offsides12Corners37\n\n\n\nSource: UEFA.com\n\n\n\nFirst Half: The dominance of Spain and a professional finishing touch\n\n\n\nMariona Caldentey put Spain ahead in the 25th minute after she cooly stepped through Hannah Hampton after combined works of Aitana Bonmati and Jenni Hermoso. La Roja were accurate and systematic in defending the ball and had the game under control with 65 percent possession and they did better with more than 750 successful passes.\n\n\n\nEngland had difficulties keeping possession of the ball but managed to destroy two decent opportunities on the wings. Ella Toone and Lauren Hemp almost did it, but the last finish did not have a sense of peace.\n\n\n\nSecond Half: Russo answers back\n\n\n\nIn the second half, Alessia Russo showed her poacher instincts in the 57th-minute when she was quickest to react to a rebound of a shot by Chloe Kelly and struck it underneath the Spanish goalkeeper Cata Coll.\n\n\n\nThe Lionesses dominated the physical game, and they gave Spanish defenders a rough time with swift changes. Despite Spain having more opportunities (22 shots in total), Spain failed them in the most important moments in front of the goal.\n\n\n\nThe Goalkeepers Shine at the Extra Time\n\n\n\nThe added time did not change the situation on the scoreboard, but it was rather exciting. Hannah Hampton made two saves of world-class, to deny Caldentey and Bonmat, and Cata Coll also had to save her team when she defended a late header by Hemp with a dive.\n\n\n\nThe Drama of Penalty Shootout\n\n\n\nEngland maintained a composure in the penalty shoot-out where they had scored three of their spot kicks as compared to Spain which only scored one spot kick.\n\n\n\nPenalty Shootout Summary:\n\n\n\nPenalty OrderEngland (Scored/Missed)Spain (Scored/Missed)1st\u274c Mead\u2705 Guijarro2nd\u2705 Greenwood\u274c Paralluelo3rd\u2705 Charleswood\u274c Caldentey4th\u274c Williamson\u274c Bonmat\u00ed5th\u2705 Kelly\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe defining moment came when Charleswood smashed home England\u2019s third, and Aitana Bonmat\u00ed\u2019s miss confirmed Spain\u2019s defeat.\n\n\n\nWoman of the Match: Hannah Hampton\n\n\n\nThe player of the match was England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton for her spectacular saves in extra time and the two penalty saves that turned the game into a shootout. It was a tutorial of pressure on composure.\n\n\n\nTactical Overview\n\n\n\nSpain:\n\n\n\n\nDominated the midfield: Bonmati and Patri Guijarro.\n\n\n\nCreated additional opportunities but not sharp in the third part.\n\n\n\nHigh pressing game worked against England, however, it left space in the transitions.\n\n\n\n\nEngland:\n\n\n\n\nSqueezing 4-2-3-1 formation dealt with pressure well.\n\n\n\nKey opportunities were opened by counterattacks using Hemp and Kelly.\n\n\n\nBet on Russo\u2019s clinical finishing and goals keeping brilliance of Hampton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Significance\n\n\n\n\nThe 2nd Euro Title of England: The Lionesses won their Euro in 2022 at Wembley; this second title made them defend their European title.\n\n\n\nSpain: Lost Initiative: Spain goes into the final with a great track record of having won all their matches so far and topping most of the other statistics feature, yet Spain is still waiting out another European championship title (in 1997 Spain finished second).\n\n\n\nFirst Euro Final with Penalties Since 2001: It was the second time Women Euro final was decided by penalty shootout since 2001.\n\n\n\n\nWhat They Said?\n\n\n\nSarina Wiegman (England Coach):\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a tough, tactical battle. Spain pushed us to the limits, but our team showed heart, determination, and a championship mentality.\u201d\n\n\n\nMontse Tom\u00e9 (Spain Coach):\n\n\n\n\u201cWe played beautiful football but didn\u2019t convert when it mattered most. Credit to England, they punished our mistakes and defended like champions.\u201d\n\n\n\nFan Reactions of the UEFA Women\u2019s Euro 2025 Final: England Edge Past Spain in Penalty Shootout Thriller to Defend Title\n\n\n\nFans across England erupted in celebration as the Lionesses completed another fairy-tale run. Trafalgar Square in London saw thousands gather to watch the game live, while social media platforms flooded with congratulatory messages for Sarina Wiegman\u2019s team.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Spanish supporters acknowledged the team\u2019s flair and future potential, applauding their unbeaten run to the final and possession-based dominance throughout the tournament.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\n\n\nThe 2025 UEFA Women\u2019s Euro marked another milestone in the exponential growth of women\u2019s football across Europe. With record attendance, global viewership, and top-class talent on display, the stage is now set for the 2027 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nWhen Rishabh Pant suffered a fractured right toe during the fourth Test at Old Trafford, it wasn\u2019t just a medical setback\u2014it was a seismic blow to India\u2019s hopes of leveling the series. India went into the fifth Test trailing 1\u20132 and needing a win at The Oval to keep their WTC\u202f25 campaign alive. Pant\u2019s abrupt exit reshaped India\u2019s batting depth, morale, and tactical approach.\n\n\n\nInjury Timeline & Severity\n\n\n\nOn Day\u202f1 of the 4th Test, Pant injured his right foot while reverse-sweeping Chris Woakes. He was carted off in visible pain and scans later confirmed a fractured toe, ruling him out of wicketkeeping duties and the final Test.\n\n\n\nRemarkably, less than 24 hours later, Pant returned to bat, limping but determined, to add 54 off 75 balls, helping India reach a first-innings score of 321\u20116.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this effort, BCCI confirmed he would miss the 5th Test (from July\u202f31 at The Oval), replaced by Narayan Jagadeesan as backup keeper. \n\n\n\nImpact on India\u2019s Performance\n\n\n\nPant entered the 4th Test having scored 479 runs in seven innings, with an average of 68.43, including two centuries and three half-centuries. He was India\u2019s second-highest run-scorer in the WTC series.\n\n\n\nHis injury came at a critical juncture\u2014India needed at least 350\u2013400 runs to challenge England. Without him, they struggled to build momentum. Former England captain Michael Vaughan estimated a 25% swing in England\u2019s favour due to Pant\u2019s absence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s reliance on Pant\u2019s attacking temperament and ability to absorb pressure proved irreplaceable. With Dhruv Jurel or Narayan Jagadeesan stepping in, India lacked his experience and firepower in the lower order. The absence also disrupted team balance\u2014no more aggressive batting depth combined with tactical flexibility behind the stumps.\n\n\n\nStrategic & Psychological Fallout\n\n\n\nPant wasn\u2019t just a batter\u2014he was vice-captain and a key vocal leader. His presence influenced team energy, field placements, and dressing-room morale. Without him, India looked dented, especially under England\u2019s Bazball-style momentum. \n\n\n\nTactical options narrowed: without Pant available to bat, India\u2019s lower middle-order had to reconfigure roles. They also lost his wicketkeeping agility\u2014affecting strategic decisions related to slip and short-leg placements.\n\n\n\nComparing before and after data\n\n\n\nBefore injury: Pant averaging 68+ with two hundreds and three fifties in the series, anchoring India\u2019s lower middle-order in English conditions.\n\n\n\nImpact: India\u2019s 4th Test was salvaged partly thanks to Pant\u2019s resistance. But his absence in the 5th Test coincided with a clear dip in team confidence and batting fluidity, particularly in crunch scenarios.\n\n\n\nBroader Significance\n\n\n\nPant\u2019s early exit increased pressure on Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, and others to fill the void, yet none had his fearless touch in that position under pressure.\n\n\n\nSubstituting a top-order keeper-batter mid-series disrupts momentum\u2014not just on the scoreboard but in squad dynamics. This injury forced India to rely on backup wicketkeepers who had zero Test experience, shifting match planning significantly.\n\n\n\nHead Coach Gautam Gabhir said, \u201cthat the foundation of his team will be based on what Rishabh Pant has done. I hate talking about individuals- I\u2019ve never done that in a team sport. But you\u2019ve not only inspired this dressing room.. you\u2019ve inspired the net generation.\u201d\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nRishabh Pant\u2019s injury in Manchester was more than just a medical blow\u2014it was a seismic shift in India\u2019s Test strategy and mental fabric. From anchoring innings to influencing match tempo, his absence affected batting depth, leadership structure, and overall momentum. Even his gritty 54 before retiring highlighted what India stood to lose.\n\n\n\nTest cricket often turns on small margins\u2014and sometimes, it\u2019s the absence of a single player that shifts the entire balance.\n\n\n\n\n",

After nearly a decade of loyalty, trophies, and countless saves, his decision to undergo surgery announced without club coordination has strained ties. Once a symbol of stability, his future as captain and starter hangs in doubt, leaving fans torn between admiration for his legacy and concern for what\u2019s next. Source: as.com\n\n\n\nSurgery Fallout: The Three\u2011Month Dispute\n\n\n\nTer Stegen\u2019s own announcement estimated a three month recovery window. But Dr. Ripoll, a Catalan medical expert, called that \u201cvery tight,\u201d suggesting the real timetable is closer to four months or more the threshold for Barcelona using 80% of his salary cap to register reinforcements.\n\n\n\n\nDear Culers,I wear the colors and jersey of FC Barcelona with great pride, whether on or off the pitch, in moments of success and in difficult times. Today is a personally difficult day for me. Physically and athletically, I feel in very good shape, although unfortunately I\u2026\u2014 Marc ter Stegen (@mterstegen1) July 24, 2025\n\n\n\n\nFrom the club\u2019s perspective, that three month timeline disrupts their financial manoeuvring: they can\u2019t de-register him under the long\u2011term injury rule unless the absence exceeds four months.\n\n\n\nSource: mundodeportivo\n\n\n\nLeadership Under Strain: Captaincy in Doubt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the fallout, internal factions at Bar\u00e7a reportedly want to strip ter Stegen of the captain\u2019s armband. The captaincy group Ronald Araujo, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong, and Raphinha stands ready, with Inigo Mart\u00ednez and Lewandowski also suggested as possible new leaders.\u00a0\n\n\n\nClub icons and staff allegedly see a keeper on the bench as unfit for the mantle. And ter Stegen\u2019s unilateral decision to break the surgery news only intensified tensions.\u00a0Source: elpais.com\n\n\n\nSporting Decline\n\n\n\nA long-time heroes for Bar\u00e7a, ter Stegen enjoyed a glittering era with six La\u202fLiga titles, a Champions League, and a Zamora Trophy for conceding just 18 goals in 2022\u201323 across 38 league appearances. He matched Paco Lia\u00f1o\u2019s record of 26 clean sheets that season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe made his 400th appearance in March 2024, becoming Barcelona\u2019s most capped foreign player after Messi. But a ruptured patellar tendon ruled him out from September 2024 until May 2025 hard times for any captain.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGermany at Stake: World Cup Hopes in Jeopardy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Manuel Neuer retired from international duty, Julian Nagelsmann has long asserted \u201cif Marc is fit, he is Germany\u2019s No.\u202f1\u201d\u202fbut his position is precarious if he\u2019s not playing regularly at club level.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGerman outlets like Bild warn firmly: unless ter Stegen moves to a club where he plays, his 2026 FIFA World Cup dreams may be over. National expectations and competitive fitness seldom collide in mercy.\n\n\n\nBar\u00e7a\u2019s Financial Chess: Registering New Signings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe arrival of Joan Garc\u00eda from Espanyol for \u20ac25\u202fM has intensified the crunch. Bar\u00e7a hope to use Ter Stegen\u2019s absence via the four\u2011month rule to allocate 80% of his salary and register Garc\u00eda and Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, whose contract was only recently extended.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf the break is shorter, Bar\u00e7a can\u2019t activate this mechanism, blocking Garc\u00eda and Szcz\u0119sny\u2019s registrations and leaving Inaki Pe\u00f1a (the only fit keeper registered) as default starter. That is untenable. \u00a0\n\n\n\nSource: mundodeportivo\n\n\n\nA Broken Bond\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years, ter Stegen\u2019s name was written into Bar\u00e7a\u2019s identity: modern sweeper-keeper, composed passer, leadership symbol. Fans and legends saw him as comparable to V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow his relationship with the club feels fractured. He expressed sadness about not being able to help his team, yet club channels interpreted a unilateral communication not a shared one as defiance.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn Reddit forums, supporters voiced mixed feelings:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was an absolute wall\u2026 but recently cost us in big matches.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want you back\u201d amid debate over his reliability under pressure.\u201d Source\n\n\n\n\nTer Stegen\u2019s Current Standing\n\n\n\nAspectStatus / ImpactInjury & RecoveryAnnounced 3\u2011month recovery; medical sources expect ~4+ monthsLong\u2011term injury ruleBar\u00e7a needs >4\u2011month absence to apply 80% salary relief to register Garc\u00edaCaptaincy stormUnder intense scrutiny; club considering stripping him of armbandSporting status at Bar\u00e7aGarc\u00eda and Szcz\u0119sny are expected to play ahead of ter Stegen, but formal demotion awaits his return to match fitness and official club decisionNational team implicationsGermany\u2019s No.\u202f1 if fit\u2014but may lose spot without regular club minutesEmotional fan connectionFallen from hero status; once revered, now caught in a troubled saga\n\n\n\nLegacy Versus Realism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarc\u2011Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen\u2019s story is not just about injuries it\u2019s about control, professionalism, and identity.

His contract runs through 2028, but his trajectory may be measured now in months, not years.\u00a0 Source: welt.de\n\n\n\nThe coming weeks surgery, absence duration, registration decisions, captaincy vote will determine whether history remembers him as a Bar\u00e7a legend or a cautionary endnote.

      "content_full": "\nThe English Ben Stokes appeared like a thunderbolt when he made his debut on the pitch when the spotlight reached the Old Trafford pitch in Manchester. He was quiet when he played, but he played thunder. Stokes is known to rise to the situation when the chips are down and the fourth Test between India and England was an ideal one where he could show it.\n\n\n\nFirst, he ended the 2-year spell of a hundred droughts. His next stop was India, where he ripped through the batting line-up, taking a five-wicket haul to shake the visitors. Stokes was not just a plugger; he was a director. His performance resounded in the locker rooms, behind the microphone, and in record books during the next decades.\n\n\n\nStokes the batter: A return to Roar:\n\n\n\nStokes return to form with the bat came just when England needed consolidation and momentum. Walking in after \u00a0a solid foundation was laid by Joe Root, Stokes settled in with precision, letting the pitch speak before letting his bat do the talking.\n\n\n\nShortly before the morning drinks break, he brought up his first test hundred in over two years, a sign of belief for fans and a roar of redemption for himself. With deft touches and powerful strokes, he reminded everyone of\u00a0 the Stokes who pulled off the Headingley miracle, the World Cup final hero, and the Ashes warrior. His 141-run partnership wasn\u2019t just about personal glory.\n\n\n\nIt was crafted to grind down India\u2019s spirit. Two massive sixes down the ground showed his aggression, while his Partnerships\u00a0 helped propel England to a towering 669, their highest total at the venue and one that left India chasing shadows.\n\n\n\nStokes the blower: Breaking the backbone\n\n\n\nIf his batting efforts turned heads, his bowling spell broke backs. Having already been England\u2019s most effective pacer throughout the series, he once again demonstrated his ability to deliver under pressure with the ball with relentless hostile lengths, tight lengths and clever variation. His 5/72 in the first innings included the prized wicket of Shubman Gill, India\u2019s vice captain, who had shown flashes of brilliance earlier in the series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dismissal of LBW in a tense captain vs. captain moment was the highlight of the match. Stokes didn\u2019t stop there. His removal of Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar effectively snuffed out India\u2019s lower-order resistance, ensuring that England maintained the upper hand heading into the second innings. With that fifer, Stokes joined elite English company.\n\n\n\nOnly three other Englishmen Tony Greig, lan Banton and Gus Atkinson have managed double centuries and five-wicket hauls in the same test. Even more remarkably, only five test captains across all nations have achieved his feat.\n\n\n\nFatigue and Fitness: A cloud over Day 5\n\n\n\nHowever, not all of Stokes\u2019 impact was positive, at least not in terms of England\u2019s strategy moving forward. After winning everything with bat and ball strokes, he looked visibly stiff, struggling with cramps towards the end of the innings. When England began their second innings, Stokes was absent from the bowling attack. His inability to bowl on Day 4 raised the questions and concerns. Without their captain, England\u2019s bowling unit lacked the bite and balance they had earlier.\n\n\n\nAs KL Rahul and Shubham Gill mounted a strong resistance with an unbeaten 174-run partnership, England\u2019s grip on the game began to loosen. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick confirmed Stokes was dealing with soreness from his heavy workload, stating that they were hopeful he could return on Day 5. But without him, England looks far less threatening.\n\n\n\nWhether he blows on Day 5 or not could decide the match. But win or lose, his all-round heroics have already etched a timeless chapter in modern cricket.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe new football season is just around the corner, and teams are making their final preparations. While most clubs are aiming to improve on last year\u2019s results, Mohun Bagan Super Giant has bigger goals. They are not only looking to defend their Indian Super League (ISL) title but also aiming to make a strong impact in the upcoming AFC Champions League 2. With top clubs from across Asia in the mix, the competition will be tougher than ever.\n\n\n\nThis makes the schedule for the Mariners even tougher and due to that, Mohun Bagan is not keeping anything unturned, even after getting a ban from FIFA.\n\n\n\nNew Mariner\u2019s Arrivals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defending ISL shield and cup holders will look forward to rewrite the history books in Indian football by winning back to back double in ISL and they are also looking to perform in the continental championship as well and for achieving this success, Mohun Bagan is down to building a solid team for this season. \n\n\n\nThey have already signed and announced the players, like Kiyan Nassiri from Chennaiyn FC and Abhishek Singh from Punjab FC. These two signings can play a crucial role in Mohun Bagan\u2019s success this season, as Kiyan Nassiri will add an extra option on the wing in place of Liston or Manvir and he\u2019s pretty quick and explosive and has also proved himself in big games, like scoring a hat trick against East Bengal. Along with that, he is pretty explosive as a player who can turn the game on its head with his own caliber.\n\n\n\n Abhishek Singh is a young left back who is pretty versatile both while defending attacks or carrying out attacks, he can deliver crosses and also can play in both flanks, so he can play as a starter in place of Ashis Rai on the right as he is facing problems in that position for last two seasons and also can act as a backup for Subhashis Bose on the left. \n\n\n\nAccording to some rumors, Mohun Bagan is also trying to sign Robson Robinho from Basundhara Kings to replace Greg Steward, a pretty similar kind of player who can act as a playmaker and as a goalscorer as well and this may increase the flair of the star-studded front line of Mohun Bagan.\n\n\n\nAlthough, Mohun Bagan\u2019s transfer market has been pretty quiet in comparison to last some seasons due to the ban they faced from FIFA and had to pay the fine to FIFA, yet they managed to sign two top class Indian Youngster for their team which already has a strong core and together they can make the dream a reality.\n\n\n\nPossible Challenges for the Mariners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Mohun Bagan have made a strong side on paper, their challenges remain on the field. As the foreigners like Dimi Petratos, Jason Cummings, and Jamie McLaren will be joining the team late, as scheduled, the coach may face some problems as those players may become rusty after not playing for so long and also not getting adequate time to prepare themselves as the Durand Cup has already begun and Mohun Bagan will play their first match against Mohammedan SC with a total Indian core, which can act as a moral boost for the Indian players, but to achieve everything, their foreign players must step up.\n\n\n\nAnother possible challenge Mohun Bagan can face is having a hefty schedule, as Mohun Bagan will be playing in AFC Champions League 2 as well, which will make the schedule even more compact and hectic for the players. Due to this kind of schedule, players may experience tiredness, soreness and even injuries, and due to this, Mohun Bagan\u2019s squad depth will play an important part in their success. If the bench remains strong, coach Jose Molina can use the quality on the bench to manage the workload of the players who are more fatigued.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nWith all the scheme of things keeping in mind, Mohun Bagan fans should stay optimistic about the performance from the team, as they have all the necessary ingredients to make this season another success like the last two seasons and if they do well on the international stage, this can mark the start of a new era for Mohun Bagan and it will not be anything short of a thing of pride for the Mohun Bagan fans.\n\n\n\nAs things are showing up on the paper, Mohun Bagan should win at least one or two pieces of silverware this season. Now we have to wait till the season unfolds in front of us. Mohun Bagan will start their season through the Durand Cup on 31st July against Mohammedan SC and we have a idea about the plans with which Mohun Bagan is looking to play.\n\n\n\nMore Stories:\n\n\n\n\nUEFA Women\u2019s Euro 2025 Final Preview: England vs Spain in Basel Battle\n\n\n\nDortmund closing in on big signing\u2014this could flip the attack wide open\n\n\n\nTop 4 Borussia Dortmund Players Leading the Charge in 2025\n\n\n\nMartand Raina Steps Up as the Future of Indian Defense\n\n",

Once hailed as Manchester United\u2019s golden boy, Marcus Rashford joined FC Barcelona on a\u00a0season-long loan from Manchester United, not via a full transfer. \n\n\n\nThere is an option to buy at the end of the 2025-26 season for around \u20ac30\u201335 million if Barcelona chooses to make it permanent. For Rashford, it\u2019s a chance to rewrite a narrative that slipped from his hands. And for the fans it\u2019s hope, wrapped in nostalgia and raw emotion.\n\n\n\nEarly Breakthrough and Manchester United Legacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Rashford exploded onto the scene in 2016, scoring a brace on his senior debut in the Europa League against FC Midtjylland at 18. United progressed past Midtjylland and into the Round of 16.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFrom 2015-16 through 2023-24, Rashford made 426 appearances for Manchester United, scoring 138 goals across competitions, including 87 Premier League goals, placing him among United\u2019s top scorers in the modern era. He also supplied 40 Premier League assists. His overall United record: a goal every 226 minutes and a goal\u202f+\u202fassist every 155 minutes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHis peak came in 2022-23 with 17 league goals, 6 Europa League goals, and 6 EFL Cup goals, totaling 30 goals in 56 appearances, his most prolific season.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYet from late 2023 onward, Rashford\u2019s output declined. In 2023\u201124: 33 league appearances yielded just 7 goals and no Champions League goals. Source: Expressandstar.com\n\n\n\nChanging Fortunes under Amorim and Ten Hag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the managerial shift to Ruben Amorim, Rashford saw his role diminish. He was omitted from 12 consecutive match squads, stripped of the iconic No.\u202f10 shirt, and frozen out of training plans.\u00a0 Critics like Danny Murphy and Paul Pogba called out United\u2019s handling, labeling Rashford\u2019s exit to Villa a missed opportunity.\u00a0Source: Talksport.com\n\n\n\nAston Villa Loan: Revival and Relevance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2025, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan until season\u2019s end, with Villa paying at least 75% of his \u00a3315,000\u2011a\u2011week wages. There was no obligation to buy, and Villa lacked a first-option clause. \n\n\n\nIn 17 appearances for Villa, he notched 4 goals and 6 assists, earning a recall to the England squad. However, a hamstring injury prematurely sidelined him as the season closed.\n\n\n\nPremier League Impact: Game\u2011Changer Stats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince his debut with Villa, Rashford led the league in big chances created (4) and was tied for most assists (2) and most dribbles (15) in his first three matches alone. Fans on Reddit praised his resurgence:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been quality\u202f\u2026 feel like the motivation\u202f\u2026 and Emery\u2019s coaching have given Rashford the sufficient kick up the arse\u201d\u2014Villa \u201dfan.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCoach Unai Emery and pundits, including Thomas Tuchel, highlighted his renewed work rate, pressing intensity, and defensive hunger.\n\n\n\nClub / CompetitionAppsGoalsAssistsBig Chances CreatedDribblesManchester United (all comps)426138\u2014\u2014\u2014Aston Villa (loan)17464 (led PL debut)15 in early games\n\n\n\nSource: Fbref.com\n\n\n\nNew Chapter at FC Barcelona: A Story of Revival?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Rashford\u2019s shock move to FC Barcelona has sent ripples through the footballing world. After a mixed loan spell at Aston Villa and a turbulent end to his time at Manchester United, the 27-year-old forward is now set to begin a bold new chapter in Catalonia. While questions remain over his form and consistency, Barcelona sees him as a high-upside option in their evolving frontline, hoping to revive both his career and their attacking fortunes.\n\n\n\nHow Tactically Marcus Rashford Can Fit in Barcelona System\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a tactical table showing how Marcus Rashford could fit into Barcelona\u2019s system across different formations. It highlights his potential roles, positioning, and function based on Bar\u00e7a\u2019s typical tactical structures and evolving needs.\n\n\n\nFormationRashford\u2019s PositionRoleTactical Impact4-3-3 (Classic Bar\u00e7a)LW (Left Winger)Inverted winger / inside forwardOffers width and cuts inside to shoot; stretches defense; links with Pedri and Lewy4-2-3-1Inverted winger/inside forwardLM (No. 10 in press)Supports transitions, presses high, combines with Raphinha/Yamal in tight spaces3-4-3Left inside forwardAdvanced creator/off-ball runnerIdeal in transitions; breaks lines with pace; attacks back post in wide overloads4-4-2 (Diamond / Mid-block)Left-forward / SS (second striker)Drops between lines, feeds off LewandowskiAdds mobility to front two; drags defenders; can finish or create3-5-2 (Progressive build)LST (Left Striker)Vertical runner/counter-attackerWorks in half-space; presses full-backs; connects midfield and attack\n\n\n\n\nWidth vs. Inversion: Rashford naturally thrives cutting inside from the left, which is ideal in a system where Yamal holds width on the right.\n\n\n\nTransition Play: Barcelona has lacked vertical runners; Rashford brings directness in counterattacks. His combination with Balde can be a threat for teams.\n\n\n\nPressing Intensity: Can contribute defensively when motivated, especially useful in a gegenpress-lite setup.\n\n\n\nLink-up Potential: His chemistry with midfield creators like Pedri, Raphinha, or even Dani Olmo could unlock combinations Bar\u00e7a currently misses.\n\n\n\n\nIf Rashford finds his spark again in Catalonia, it could be one of those rare transfers that changes everything not just for him, but for a club and its fans who understand what redemption looks like.\n\n\n\nBecause beneath the stats, beneath the tactics, this is still the same boy from Manchester chasing the game he fell in love with. And maybe, just maybe, Barcelona is where he finally feels free to fall in love with it again.\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about\u00a0\u201cUEFA Women\u2019s Euro 2025 Final Preview.\u201d\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n",

      "content_full": "\nOn the last day of a test cricket match at Lord there was a crowd breakout and it was not a Monday off, but it felt like a bank holiday weekend. Nobody was anticipating that the stands would be full on a working day, but everyone turned out to see the type of thriller and drama that cricket alone can serve.\n\n\n\nThese scenes are rare to see. Beyond the heart of England, Australia, and New Zealand, no other country can pull off a crowd with the same passion and numbers. While stadiums like Lord\u2019s, MCG, and Queenstown are vibrant with atmosphere, many of the other Test venues around the world lie in silence.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSouth Africa has fewer matches and smaller crowds. The West Indies, where the game once produced heroes, is now struggling to draw an audience for the shorter formats. For countries like Ireland, Zimbabwe, and Afghanistan, the five-day game struggles to be included in the calendar.\n\n\n\nWhy test cricket is not thriving in India\n\n\n\nIndia is the powerhouse of cricket in all possible aspects, especially in the commercial aspect. BCCI is doing everything to strengthen cricket at all levels. But they still need to crack the code of Test cricket and draw the crowd into the stadiums. India is the heart of cricket, but test cricket doesn\u2019t thrive at the grassroots level or in a crowd culture.\n\n\n\nMarquee series, like the BGT, have a great viewership and huge interest. Most Test matches in India, especially against less competitive teams, will have very little crowd attendance. Although fans are passionate about it, it lacks marketing efforts to promote test cricket. BCCI promotes T20I & IPL way more aggressively than test cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, countries like England and Australia built a culture around Test cricket. The Ashes is more of a social event than a sporting event. The scheduling is done with the crowd in mind, usually on weekends or holidays. They also have a clear marketing plan and fan engagement. Even New Zealand, with a smaller pool to draw from, embraces Test cricket as a tactical, subtle, and intense contest that draws in loyal followers.\n\n\n\nWhere the whites still matter the most\n\n\n\nWhile test cricket is swinging like a pendulum in other countries, including India. Some places cherish and love test cricket, not just play it. In England, the Ashes is a national event. You would see fans queuing outside Lord\u2019s and Headingley at early morning hours. Lord\u2019s test matches are a red-carpet event; everyone dresses like a celebrity and enjoys the match. It seems like suits are the dress code there.\n\n\n\nAustralia also has a similar set of customs; the Boxing Day Tests attract around 60-70,000 fans on Day 1, and a Test match is still seen as the ultimate test of cricketing quality over five days. They gave a premium experience to their fans to fully enjoy the game.\n\n\n\nEven in New Zealand, with a much smaller cricket economy, Test matches retain some relevance. Matches in Wellington or Christchurch don\u2019t have such large stadiums, but those fans stay invested for five days. \u00a0In these countries, test cricket is celebrated with pride, intent, and an engaged crowd.\n\n\n\nWhat can India and others learn from test strongholds?\n\n\n\nIndia has the history, talent, and funding to make Test cricket relevant. But it sometimes lacks a structured, event-driven approach, as seen in England and Australia. In England, Test cricket is booked far in advance, marketed heavily, and scheduled mostly on weekdays to draw a weekend crowd. Australia has a national experience around its iconic Test matches, like the Boxing Day Test and the New Year\u2019s Day pink-ball Test. It has extensive media coverage and fan participation.\n\n\n\nIn India, test matches are not seen as marquee events at all. The minimum promotion, broken ticketing processes, and unreliable scheduling. Pitches are often rank turners or flat like a road. To draw interest, the BCCI could elevate cricket by prioritizing iconic venues such as Eden Gardens, Wankhede, Dharamshala, and Chepauk. BCCI must also focus on providing sporting pitches and considering day-night tests as part of it, rather than testing options.\n\n\n\nCountries where test cricket is fading, like South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the West Indies, must redefine the experience as a marquee experience. Boards must provide better financial stability and clear pathways for red-ball cricket. They also provide stability with scheduling so that players can prioritize Test cricket. Equally, players must see Test cricket as not a burden, but the ultimate showcase of skill and legacy.\n\n\n\nReviving the soul of cricket\n\n\n\nTest cricket remains the essence of the sport, rooted in patience, tenacity, and story. In order to blossom, it needs more than just goodwill. We need to bring back aspiration. We need the boards, in particular, to promote Test cricket as an event rather than a mere match. India is best placed to show the rest of the cricket world how to invest in Test cricket through improved scheduling, fan engagement, and a commitment to red-ball cricket\n\n\n\nThe ICC must also act by ensuring a minimum number of tests for teams below the elite, increasing investment, and providing a more meaningful engagement for all nations in the World Test Championship. Otherwise, without a commitment in principle to an equitable contest for all, Test cricket may end up being a privilege for the few.\n\n\n\nFor sure, the five-day game may not be what suits the modern pace, but its value is eternal, and cricket cannot afford to lose it.\n",

He has overtaken Dravid ( 13, 288) Kallis ( 13 289) , Sangakkara ( 12, 400) and pointing ( 13, 378) . He is now second only to Sachin Tendulkar, who has 15,921 Test runs. Additionally, Root matched Sangakkara\u2019s tally of 38 centuries, making him joint third in the list of the players with the most Test hundreds.\n\n\n\nMilestones in a single innings\n\n\n\nRoot reached several key\u00a0 landmarks during his innings. A simple single took him past Rahul Dravid, followed by a boundary to overtake Kallis. His fifty came with a controlled short, and another stylish boundary matched Sangakkara\u2019s century count. A precise third man shot eventually helped leap past Pointing. All of this happened in the span of a single masterful inning.\n\n\n\nInterestingly\u00a0 this innings took Root past 1000 test\u00a0 runs at Old Trafford , home ground to Lancashire , home ground to\u00a0 Lancashire , Yorkshire born cricketer it was a special moment . But for\u00a0 Root it was just another demonstration of his ability to Score under any condition ,\u00a0 against any attack, and at any venue\n\n\n\nConsistency over a decade\n\n\n\nSince making his test debut in 2012, Root has become England\u2019s most dependable batter. In 139\u00a0 tests he scored 13,409 runs at an average above 50. With 38 centuries and 67 half centuries, including a top score of 254 , Root has combined longevity with consistent excellence\n\n\n\nWhat sets Root apart is his ability to adapt his technique to the situation. He plays late against pace, uses soft hands against spin and finds gaps effortlessly. His deflection to third man, cover drives and sweep shots are now iconic. Rarely flashy, Root builds innings patiently and clinically, making him one of the most difficult batters to dismiss in Test cricket.\n\n\n\nTurning Fifties into Hundreds:\n\n\n\nEarly in his career, Root was often criticized for failing to convert fifties into hundreds. But in recent years the trend has changed. Since 2021 he has consistently scored big hundreds, especially when the rest of the batting lineup has struggled. His centuries in India, Sri Lanka and Australia during challenges conditions have stood out as match saving knocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot is currently 34 years old. If he maintains\u00a0 fitness and continues performing, he could have another 2-3 years at the top. The England team still relies heavily on him and his hunger for runs hasn\u2019t slowed. Breaking Tendulkar\u2019s record depends on not just talent but resilience, match availability and mental strength, all areas where Root continues to excel.\n\n\n\nA Proud\u00a0 moment for English cricket.\n\n\n\nRoot achieved a high point in English cricket. No other batter has come close to this level of Test dominance. He is setting an example for future generations, proving that success in test cricket still holds immense value even in a world obsessed with T20 leagues.\n\n\n\nWith each milestone, Root is not just building a record; he is cementing his legacy. He played in every major Cricketing conditions against toughest blowers and under high pressure . His rise up the rankings isn\u2019t the result of one great year; it is a result of a decade-long commitment to excellence.\n\n\n\nMore Stories:\n\n\n\n\nRoger Binny turns 70: BCCI Presidency in Turmoil Amid Age Limit Controversy\n\n\n\nWhy Test Cricket Pushes the Human Body to Its Limits\n\n\n\nIndian Women Cricket Team Creates History in England with T20I and ODI Series Wins\n\n\n\nIs T20 the Future of Cricket?

The match kicks off at 9:30 PM IST, streaming exclusively on FanCode for Indian viewers.\n\n\n\nOne Trophy, Two Titans\n\n\n\nBoth England and Spain have two different stories yet equal ambition and thus the clash is the one that will be a tactical as well as an emotional roller coaster. The two sides had squeezed through tense semi-finals in which they demonstrated their resilience, late drama and individual excellence.\n\n\n\nThe heartwarming Semi-Final come-back of England: The story of heart and grit against Italy\n\n\n\nEngland pulled off one of the most dramatic matches of the tournament and narrowly defeated Italy 2-1 in Geneva, having sent the game to extra time. Italy had gone ahead to the surprise of the audience in the 33rd minute after Barbara Bonansea had taken advantage of a rare defensive error in the England back line. Throughout most of the game, the Lionesses were a team bound to exit the championship. However, through a spectacular goal in the 90+6-minute equalizer by Michelle Agyemang, who is 18 years old, the game changed when the penalty kick was rung off and rebounded and scored by Chloe Kelly in the 119th minute.\n\n\n\nManager Sarina Wiegman praised the character of her team: \u201cThis group does not give up. We want to be in it until the very last moment, and it is that faith that brought us here tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\nEngland now qualified for the consecutive Euro final with a newfound swagger and an opportunity to become the first team to win the trophy back-to-back.\n\n\n\nSpain silence Germany in spine-tingling manner on extra time\n\n\n\nSpain won the semifinal game 1-0 against Germany in extra time in Zurich to claim their maiden final to play in the UEFA Women\u2019s Euro. Following 112 minutes of drama, with the game stretched end to end, it was once again the last year Ballon d\u2019Or winner, Aitana Bonmati, who settled the game with a curling shot that left German keeper Ann-Katrin Berger stranded.\n\n\n\nSpain controlled most of the game (60%) and recorded more than 500 passes in the game, as they played their tiki-taka game under head coach Montserrat Tom. Although the Germans made a well-coordinated defensive fight, the fierce pressure in the midfield eventually broke the stitching against Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead-to-Head: England vs Spain\n\n\n\n\nTotal Meetings: 9\n\n\n\nEngland Wins: 3\n\n\n\nSpain Wins: 2\n\n\n\nDraws: 4\n\n\n\nLast Meeting: FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 Final: Spain 1\u20130 England\n\n\n\n\nSpain may have the psychological edge, having defeated England in the 2023 World Cup final, but England is out for revenge on European soil.\n\n\n\nKey Players to Watch\n\n\n\nEngland\n\n\n\n\nChloe Kelly (Forward): The extra-time scorer against Italy has scored 3 goals at the tournament so far, with two of them deciding the matches. Known as the box doll through her speed and calm.\n\n\n\nMichelle Agyemang (Forward): Agyemang is a sensation at only 18 years of age.

Should it occur, then it would likely be a massive statement to them in the transfer market.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAt just 21 years old, Hutchinson already has experience at Arsenal, Chelsea, and most recently Ipswich Town, where he played 31 Premier League games this past season. Although Ipswich Town is relegated in the Premier League, there was an exception: Hutchinson.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe scored 3 goals and 2 assists in 31 top-flight games, which is not a lot on paper, but the finer numbers are more telling here. Hutchinson also created 81 shot-creating actions over the season and ended up with an xG of 2.9 and an xAG of 3.5, indicating that he entered the final third regularly and had an effect. Those are good indicators of his future potential as a young player on a poor team.\n\n\n\nWhat does Hutchinson bring to Dortmund?\n\n\n\nHutchinson is not refined yet, but this is what makes him a perfect choice for Borussia Dortmund. He already has raw skills that BVB adores to develop. His best attribute is versatility: he can be deployed on either wing or as a central attacking midfielder, providing Nuri \u015eahin with a lot of possibilities when it comes to forming the front four. His 1.78 successful take-ons per 90 minutes show that he is not only technically proficient but also not afraid of an opponent in a one-on-one situation, which is something unique at his age and could do wonders in Dortmund.\n\n\n\nWhat does Hutchinson bring to Dortmund?\n\n\n\nAlthough his former club had a disappointing season, Hutchinson never gave up; he pressed, chased back, and never dropped out of the game even when his club was losing. That attempt speaks volumes of the kind of person he is, which is precisely what the wide players of Dortmund will be asked to display.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBusiness-wise, he is once again a match to the model of the club: Jude Bellingham is another case of how a young talent can become a multi-year player or have a huge resale value. To a club that likes to develop its own talent rather than purchasing it in the form of a ready-made star, Hutchinson checks a short-term depth box and a long-term opportunity.\n\n\n\nWhere would he fit in Dortmund\u2019s squad?\n\n\n\nNow it got a whole lot more interesting. In case Hutchinson joins, it appears as:\n\n\n\n\nHe will be forced to share minutes with Julien Duranville at the right wing.\n\n\n\nKarim Adeyemi may find himself under pressure in case he fails to find early form.\n\n\n\nThere is a suggestion of a change to 4-2-3-1, with Hutchinson playing in the hole behind the forward.\n\n\n\n\nThis is also an indication that the club is yet to be sure on its wide options. Whereas Adeyemi provides speed and Beier the versatility, Hutchinson would provide Dortmund with a more random, inventive edge.\n\n\n\nFinal Take\n\n\n\nOmari Hutchinson is not coming in with a massive hype, but that is the reason it seems to be a Dortmund signing. Dortmund is the club that enjoys putting pen to paper on Premier League players who are simply waiting to blow up, and that is the feeling I am getting here.\n\n\n\nIn case the transfer does occur, he will immediately feature and could receive a decent amount of playing time. Provided things work out, Dortmund might have their next breakout star.\n\n\n\nThis one\u2019s worth watching. Closely.\n\n\n\nYou May Like \u2013 \n\n\n\n\nTop 4 Borussia Dortmund Players Leading the Charge in 2025\n\n\n\nMartand Raina Steps Up as the Future of Indian Defense\n\n\n\nMajor Football Rule Changes Proposed Ahead of 2026 World Cup: VAR, Penalties & More\n\n\n\nGio Reyna at the Crossroads: Why MLS, Not Serie A, Is the Right Move to Revive His Career\n\n\n\n134th Durand Cup 2025 Preview: Full Fixtures, Teams, Venues, and Broadcast Details\n\n",

But look a little closer today, and you\u2019ll notice something curious: cricket whites aren\u2019t so uniform anymore. Subtle but significant changes in headgear, fabric, and personalization are reshaping the way cricketers express themselves\u2014even in the game\u2019s most conservative format.\n\n\n\nWelcome to Test cricket\u2019s fashion revolution. It\u2019s not loud, but it\u2019s here.\n\n\n\n1. The Era of the Iconic Cap\u2014and What\u2019s Replacing It\n\n\n\nFor decades, iconic caps defined Test teams. Australia\u2019s Baggy Green, South Africa\u2019s Green Cap, India\u2019s navy blue Test cap\u2014all stitched with tradition, and worn like badges of honor. Some players even refused to wear helmets early in their careers because the cap was seen as a mark of character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday? You\u2019ll still see those caps on Day 1 at the toss or during national anthems. But during play, they\u2019re often swapped out for high-tech helmets built for performance and\u2014more interestingly\u2014customization.\n\n\n\nModern helmets aren\u2019t just safer. They\u2019re sleeker, lighter, and more personalized. Take England\u2019s players under the Bazball era: players like Ben Stokes or Ollie Pope sport custom grills and padding to suit their comfort, along with embroidered initials or special edition colors\u2014subtle nods to individuality in a format built on sameness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven wicketkeeper helmets now carry unique padding styles, mesh for airflow in hot climates, or bold variations of the team logo. It\u2019s a balance between function, flair, and identity.\n\n\n\n2. Smart Fabric and Climate-Responsive Kits\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, Test kits were made of thick cotton\u2014sweaty, heavy, and suffocating in tropical heat. Now, as Test cricket spreads across climates from the cold, windy Oval to the blistering Ahmedabad heat, team kits have quietly evolved to suit local conditions.\n\n\n\nTeams now employ climate-specific jerseys:\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s players often wear ventilated mesh-backed whites during home Tests to cope with humidity.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s whites are designed to be thicker and more thermal, especially for early-summer Tests.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s gear includes UV-reflective coatings, ideal for long spells under harsh sunlight.\n\n\n\n\nKits are now performance wear, equipped with anti-chafing panels, moisture-wicking layers, and stretchable fabric to suit everything from a diving catch at slip to a five-hour batting grind.\n\n\n\nAnd in all of this? Style hasn\u2019t been forgotten. Slimmer fits, cleaner collars, and subtle logo placements are making whites\u2026 look cooler.\n\n\n\n3. Subtle Branding and Personal Expression\n\n\n\nYou won\u2019t see tattoos, bright shoes, or player names splashed across Test jerseys like in ODIs or T20s. But even within these quiet whites, personal branding is making its mark.\n\n\n\nTake custom spikes. Players like Virat Kohli, Steve Smith, and Joe Root wear boots in signature colorways\u2014red trim, silver laces, or branded initials. Some even add personal insignias (like Kohli\u2019s \u201cVK\u201d or Ben Stokes\u2019 initials) on wristbands or inner gloves.\n\n\n\nAccessories are another subtle rebellion. Neck gaiters, tinted sunglasses, arm sleeves, and player-specific sweatbands are increasingly common. They\u2019re not mandated by team kits\u2014but they\u2019re tolerated, and often seen as extensions of identity.\n\n\n\nAnd while Test cricket\u2019s all about team spirit, today\u2019s players know they\u2019re also brands. A small customization doesn\u2019t just feel good\u2014it builds personal equity.\n\n\n\n4. Is This the Future? Fashion in the Traditional Format\n\n\n\nCricket has always reflected its times. The 1970s brought colored clothing to ODIs. The 2000s turned IPL into a commercial spectacle of kits, kitsch, and sponsor logos. Test cricket? It stayed stoic.\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s changing\u2014gently, not loudly. Because even the most traditional things evolve. And players today are balancing legacy with individuality.\n\n\n\nWe might never see bold nameplates or neon gloves in a Test match. But we\u2019re seeing something more interesting: players using subtle style\u2014a stitched monogram, a personalized helmet chin strap, a sweatband with their daughter\u2019s name\u2014to bring a touch of self into the long, shared ritual of red-ball cricket.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Whites, but Not Blank\n\n\n\nThe whites may still define Test cricket\u2014but they no longer erase individuality. If anything, this quiet fashion revolution is proof that even in the most time-honored format, evolution isn\u2019t a threat to tradition\u2014it\u2019s a tribute to it.\n\n\n\nAs cricket moves forwardf, the best-dressed players might not be the loudest\u2014but they\u2019ll be the ones whose gear tells a story.\n",

Now, a few questions are being asked: Will Binny continue to be in his position or resign?\n\n\n\nBCCI Constitution laws\n\n\n\nOn page 30 of the BCCI constitution, it is said that if any BCCI Official turns 70, they will be disqualified and have to leave the position. The age-related provision in the BCCI\u2019s constitution was adopted under the Supreme Court of India in response to the recommendations of the Lodha Committee (Justice R.M.\u00a0Lodha Committee). Some internal sources claim that there is internal conflict in the BCCI, as no quick action is being taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some members contend that the article does not automatically require resignation in the absence of a formal challenge or direction, others maintain that the constitution ought to be upheld in all situations. But, according to some close to the former Indian cricketer, it is not necessary that any formal agreement is signed and he can continue to stay on till the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the BCCI, which is sometime in September. [Source: CricBuzz]\n\n\n\nThe Sports Governance Bill is expected to be tabled and passed during the current Monsoon Session of Parliament. The new bill is not very oppressive on the age factor, unlike the current BCCI constitution, which allows the members of the national sports federation to continue holding the post until they reach the age of 75 years.\n\n\n\nBCCI to come under National Sports Bill \ud83d\udea8\u2014 Age cap raised from 70 to 75\u2014 Roger Binny eligible for another 3-year term \u2705#BCCI #RogerBinny #India #Cricket pic.twitter.com/Y2H8hKVrOi\u2014 OneCricket (@OneCricketApp) July 22, 2025\n\n\n\nWho is going to be the next BCCI President: Rajiv Shukla?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRajeev Shukla, a seasoned cricket administrator and former Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman, and currently the vice president of the BCCI, is one candidate who is gaining popularity as rumors about Binny\u2019s potential departure grow, and it is expected that Rajiv Shukla can be a strong contender to take over the president role.\n\n\n\nAccording to sources, Rajiv Shukla has a strong political background, and his long-term association with Indian Cricket makes him the board\u2019s top pick for a seamless transition. One of BCCI\u2019s sources said, \u201cAs per convention, the senior-most office-bearer takes charge in such a scenario. Shukla will perform that role until fresh elections are held in September.\n\n\n\nMoreover, his nomination would ensure critical ongoing developments, like India\u2019s 2026 ICC T20 World Cup.\n\n\n\nNo Official Statement from Roger Binny or BCCI: Rumours buzzing!\n\n\n\nAs of now, neither the BCCI nor Roger Binny has uttered a word about this matter! There is still no clarity on what exactly is going to happen and who will be the president. High officials could not be available off the bat to comment since they were present at the just-accomplished ICC Annual Conference in Singapore.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Binny, he too preferred not to speak out. After attending an away test in London at the Lord\u2019s, he took time off earlier in the year on his 70th birthday and flew to Thailand to celebrate the event in his hometown of Bengaluru.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCricket fans and cricket experts have shown concern and kindness on social media. People speak in praise of what Binny has done, especially in enhancing the welfare of players and the conduct of domestic cricket, but on the other hand, there are concerns that rules should not be flaunted since a person is highly respected.\n\n\n\nHow and when the bill is passed by parliament may be the deciding factor on the contributions that Binny will make to the presidency. From renowned cricket player to BCCI president, Roger Binny\u2019s journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. However, the board is under pressure to enforce its regulations as it surpasses the constitutional age limit.\n",

The Dortmund team is currently confident, vibrant, and aggressive. Another new generation of world-class players is making it with strong appeal at home and on the international scene.\n\n\n\nThe path of Dortmund to the FIFA Club World Cup was legendary. They defeated Monterrey, Ulsan HD and Mamelodi Sundowns but lost in a narrow 3-2 quarter-final to Real Madrid. Despite that loss, Dortmund continues to rule home turfs with huge victories against Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate how successful the team is, we will rank the five Borussia Dortmund players that spearhead the club and display the fighting spirit of the club, technical abilities and international outlook.\n\n\n\n1. Serhou Guirassy \u2013 The Goal Machine\n\n\n\nPosition: Forward | Age: 28 | Nationality: Guinea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuirassy is killing it this season! He is also unstoppable since he transferred to Dortmund from Stuttgart, scoring 21 goals in 30 matches. This is almost one goal per game and a half, which is the dream of any striker.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt is not his finish that makes Guirassy so special. He is hard in the air, he never stops off the ball and he is never out of the box. He averages 0.73 goals without penalty per 90 minutes, which makes him one of the most productive strikers in Europe.\n\n\n\nAnd he could not have come at a better time. Dortmund had to get a reliable goalscorer and Guirassy did it. Provided that he remains healthy, he might take them far in the Champions League.\n\n\n\n2. Karim Adeyemi \u2013 The Speedster with Skill\n\n\n\nPosition: Forward/Midfielder | Age: 22 | Nationality: German\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdeyemi is the speedster of Dortmund. He is able to steal the ball on the wing and outdo the opponents before they know what has hit them and this is a challenge to the rival defenses. It is seriously impressive that his 2025 stats already read 7 goals and 6 assists in just about 1,400 minutes on the pitch.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe is also top in the league in successful dribbles and progressive carries so he is not only fast but he can actually beat the defenders. People assume that his style is similar to that of Vinicius Jr. and Bukayo Saka, and that is why people tend to compare him with them.\n\n\n\nThe outstanding thing is that he is so deadly attacking. A single play may alter an entire game.\n\n\n\n3. Gio Reyna \u2013 The Comeback Creator\n\n\n\nPosition: Midfielder | Age: 21 | Nationality: USA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReyna spent a bad phase of 2023 full of injuries and a short spell at Nottingham Forest, Reyna has returned to Dortmund. He has already bagged 2 goals in 16 games this season and he is indicating that he is regaining his form.\n\n\n\nIt is his creativity that impresses people. Reyna excels at locating teammates with precision passes and creating space. Although he does not get a lot of playing time, his numbers (0.51 goals per 90 minutes) demonstrate that he could be worth his salary at any moment when he enters the pitch.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWith Marco Reus no longer at the club, Dortmund needs a new creative player. Reyna is the one \u2014if he stays fit and confident, he could claim that mantle.\n\n\n\n4. Maximilian Beier \u2013 The Breakout Star\n\n\n\nPosition: Forward/Midfielder | Age: 21 | Nationality: Germany\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year, Borussia Dortmund appears to snatch an outstanding player. This year, such a player is Maximilian Beier. He has played out there approximately 1,500 minutes and he has already scored 8 goals and 5 assists in the score table.\n\n\n\nAlthough he has not played that many minutes in the Bundesliga, Beier surely knows what he is doing. He doesn\u2019t dribble as much as Adeyemi, but he makes clever runs and is efficient with his touches. He can also shine on the world stage, as he scored with both feet at the Club World Cup with 1.06 goals per 90 minutes.\n\n\n\nHe reminds many of Kai Havertz but is more direct in front of the goal. His expected goal (xG) numbers also back up his form, proving he\u2019s getting into the right positions consistently.\n\n\n\nFinal Words\u00a0\n\n\n\nBy 2025, Dortmund is a unique team since its attackers are all flexible. Guirassy is the finisher. The dribbler is Adeyemi. The passer is Reyna. The breakthrough is Beier. The variety of their styles leaves the opponents guessing what comes next and keeps Dortmund dangerous.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs a teen football fan, you are most likely already aware of the large names in the game. Dortmund is one team that you cannot afford to miss. These are the four Dortmund players who are making the news nowadays and may define the entire European landscape.\n",

Fast bowlers can bowl 40+ overs across 5 days, repeatedly pounding the turf with forces many times their body weight. Batters can spend entire sessions crouching, diving, and concentrating through oppressive heat or biting cold. Fielders must stay alert across long stretches where action might come once in an hour, or in a split second.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s in this crucible that chronic injuries take root. Overuse is a key factor. Unlike T20s, where workload is intense but brief, Test cricket requires sustained performance\u2014and the human body isn\u2019t always built for such demands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon chronic conditions in Test players:\n\n\n\n\nLower back stress fractures \u2013 particularly in young fast bowlers.\n\n\n\nPatellar tendonitis (jumper\u2019s knee) \u2013 frequent in wicketkeepers and bowlers.\n\n\n\nShoulder impingement and rotator cuff degeneration \u2013 common in bowlers and fielders.\n\n\n\nWrist and forearm inflammation \u2013 from constant batting or catching.\n\n\n\nChronic hamstring tightness or sciatic nerve issues \u2013 from constant crouching or sprinting.\n\n\n\n\nThese aren\u2019t freak injuries. They\u2019re slow, grinding forces that can\u2019t always be \u201cfixed\u201d\u2014only managed.\n\n\n\n2. \u201cPain Is Just a Constant Companion\u201d \u2014 The Unspoken Code\n\n\n\nIn a 2021 interview, [anonymized], a senior Indian pacer admitted, \u201cI haven\u2019t had a completely pain-free day since 2018.\u201d His back, he explained, always ached slightly after matches. During Tests, he relied on anti-inflammatories and ice baths. Off the field, it was yoga, physio work, and targeted rehab. But pain? It never truly left.\n\n\n\nThis is not uncommon.\n\n\n\nMany players live in a constant state of discomfort. A former England batsman once revealed in a 2019 piece for The Guardian that his knees \u201ccrackled every morning like dry leaves,\u201d yet he never considered sitting out unless he physically couldn\u2019t walk. \u201cYou play,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause someone else is always ready to take your place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an unspoken code in cricket\u2014especially in Tests\u2014where playing through pain is seen as heroic, even necessary. But the long-term effects can be devastating: shortened careers, diminished performance, mental fatigue, and post-retirement mobility issues.\n\n\n\n3. Medical Support: Good, But Not Always Complete\n\n\n\nTo be fair, most national teams have advanced physiotherapy and medical support staff. India, England, and Australia have built detailed workload management systems, using GPS trackers and data analytics to monitor how much a bowler is running or how many overs a keeper crouches.\n\n\n\nYet, not all boards have this luxury. In some Test nations\u2014like Bangladesh or West Indies\u2014players have voiced concerns about limited access to long-term rehabilitation. Once you\u2019re fit enough to play, you play. Period.\n\n\n\nAnd even in elite setups, there is still pressure\u2014internal and external\u2014to keep going.\n\n\n\n4. The Mental Cost of \u2018Managing\u2019 Pain\n\n\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t get enough attention is the psychological toll. Playing with chronic pain creates anxiety. Players may fear they\u2019re losing rhythm, or worse, their spot. They may start overthinking actions to avoid discomfort, leading to altered techniques and poor performance.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s Olly Stone has spoken openly about the \u201cmental exhaustion\u201d of constant rehab and the fear of re-injury. India\u2019s Jasprit Bumrah, after a long layoff due to a back stress fracture, admitted in an interview that he sometimes questioned whether his body would allow him to return to his old bowling intensity.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the real hidden cost\u2014not just physical damage, but the erosion of confidence.\n\n\n\n5. Culture Needs to Shift\n\n\n\nWe celebrate \u201ctoughness\u201d in cricket\u2014and rightly so. But in 2025, it\u2019s time to recognize that courage also lies in recovery, in honesty, and in long-term thinking. Playing through pain is noble, but hiding it should not be normalized.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a slow cultural shift underway. Players like Pat Cummins, who sat out for extended periods early in his career, now speak about the importance of load management. India has rested Bumrah, Siraj, and Shami for entire series to protect their longevity. But we still need open conversations\u2014not just about short-term injury lay-offs, but about the daily grind of invisible pain.\n",

The most recent starry-eyed person is Martand Raina. He is of Rajasthan and he is just 16 years old and he already looks like a pro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartand Raina is one of the most promising aspects of this season. He plays as a center back and is currently playing for ISL side East Bengal FC and he\u2019s just 24 years of age with a brilliant height of 6\u20192, and the Red Gold brigade will look forward towards his performance.\n\n\n\nFrom the Cradle of Aravalli to the Greenfields of Bengal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartand Raina was born in Rajasthan in a family who are Kashmiri pundits. He started his football career in Hindustan\u2019s under-18 age group team and has gone through the ranks each year. He got his first senior call-up in Rajasthan Perfect FC, where he played only 3 games in I-League 2 and scored a goal as a defender. Although that was a short stay for Martand, as the club dissolved his contract a year after, and Martand became a free agent without any club. \n\n\n\nAfter staying a year without a club, he got the call-up from Rajasthan United FC. Though it was a short stay, he started to show his potential along with his hardworking capacity; in spite of that, he stayed mostly on the bench. To get more time, he left Rajasthan United and joined Red Devils FC and played for them for a year and gained his playing time and experience and after a year, he played for Jaipur Elite FC, where he played in the I-League 3, where he played 4 matches and scored twice. \n\n\n\nAfter that spell, he went to Adamas United and played in the RFDL youth league and grabbed everyone\u2019s attention from there. With the development and regular improvement, he became one of the most promising prodigies in India and Rajasthan United signed him again but this time as their starter in defense. \n\n\n\nHe became the star of Rajasthan United and got 21 matches under his belt this time and also scored 4 goals and played a pivotal role in Rajasthan United\u2019s performance and due to that performance, an ISL call-up came for Martand Raina and it\u2019s from one of the most historic clubs in India, East Bengal FC, who signed him for 25 lakh rupees from Rajasthan United and registered him for the Durand Cup as well.\n\n\n\nFuture of East Bengal and Indian Football:\n\n\n\nWith the type of potential and performance Martand Raina is showing and improving his game with every passing year, he can surely be the ray of hope for East Bengal and also a silver lining for India as well. A defender with a good height and physicality to overpower opposition and a good sense of tackling the attackers. \n\n\n\nAlso, the quality of playing ball from the back and creating attacks from the backline\u2014Martand has got everything to be a top-level defender yet a very long way to go for him to be designated as the best defender of India but he has got all the attributes and potential to be at the pinnacle of his powers.\n\n\n\nMore Stories From Sportspedia Zone- \n\n\n\n\nMajor Football Rule Changes Proposed Ahead of 2026 World Cup: VAR, Penalties & More\n\n\n\nGio Reyna at the Crossroads: Why MLS, Not Serie A, Is the Right Move to Revive His Career\n\n\n\n134th Durand Cup 2025 Preview: Full Fixtures, Teams, Venues, and Broadcast Details\n\n\n\nDurand Cup 2025: Celebrating 134th Edition of Indian Football\u2019s Most Historic Competition\n\n",

The WPL has also established a pipeline of raw talent, and the players have managed to handle high-pressure games and matches played at a rapid pace. \n\n\n\nHaving the right mix between youth and experience, the Indian team in England has been a group that is deep, strategic and flexible, whose qualities have changed considerably in recent years. This is not a single extraordinary performance during this tour, as there is a bigger revolution in women\u2019s cricket in India.\n\n\n\nRight up to a fearless strokeplay of Shafali Verma, ascents of young talents in the WPL like Titas Sadhu and Charani on pitches in a foreign land, the WPL has re-discovered a new breed of athletes who are eager to take the big stage. The new success of India is also abacus on the back of an advanced domestic system, better fitness regimes, and exposure to high performance in A-tours and ICC tournaments. \n\n\n\nThe coach Amol Muzumdar has also focused on data-based preparation and situational work that can be seen in Indian better producing death bowling and successive strikes in the middle overs.\n\n\n\nT20I Series Recap: India Edged Past England 3-2\n\n\n\n1st T20I \u2013 Nottingham (June 28):India laid down the marker early at Trent Bridge with a dominant 97-run win.

The bowlers backed it up by bundling out England for 113, with Deepti Sharma taking 3 wickets.\n\n\n\n2nd T20I \u2013 Bristol (July 1):India continued their dominance, defending 181/4 against England\u2019s 157/7. Smriti Mandhana scored a fluent 62 while Renuka Singh Thakur returned with economical bowling figures. India took a 2-0 lead with a 24-run win.\n\n\n\n3rd T20I \u2013 London (July 4):England fought back at The Oval with a thrilling 5-run victory. India\u2019s chase of 172 fell just short at 166/5 despite Jemimah Rodrigues\u2019 late heroics.\n\n\n\n4th T20I \u2013 Manchester (July 9):England leveled the series 2-2 with a nervy 6-wicket win. Chasing 127, they reached the target with 3 balls to spare. The match highlighted India\u2019s middle-order vulnerability.\n\n\n\n5th T20I \u2013 Birmingham (July 12):With the series on the line, India held their nerve at Edgbaston. Chasing 169, India romped home with 5 wickets in hand and an over to spare, led by captain Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s match-winning 54 runs. India sealed the series 3-2.\n\n\n\nSeries Summary:\n\n\n\n\nResult: India won 3-2\n\n\n\nTop Run-Scorer: Nat-Sciver Brunt with 160 runs\n\n\n\nHighest Wicket-Taker: Kranti Goud with 9 wickets\n\n\n\nPlayer of the Series: Harmanpreet Kaur\n\n\n\n\nODI Series Recap: India Clinched 2-1 Win Over England\n\n\n\n1st ODI \u2013 Southampton (July 16):India began the ODI leg with a tight 4-wicket win.

England, chasing 143 in 23 overs, won by 8 wickets to level the series. Despite Pooja Vastrakar\u2019s early breakthroughs, England\u2019s top order held firm.\n\n\n\n3rd ODI \u2013 Chester-le-Street (July 22):India saved their best for last, producing a clinical performance. After putting up 318/5, thanks to a scintillating 103 by Smriti Mandhana, they bowled England out for 305, winning by 13 runs.

The increasing competitiveness of the sport can be heard in India as the country romped to glorious victories in England, what was once a tough hunting ground. \n\n\n\nMandhana and Harmanpreet continue to be among the top 5 most followed female sports personalities in India and WPL 2025 season opened with the best-ever TV viewership of 140 million as per Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). Having been broadcast successfully, drawing larger audiences, and with more investment, the Indian Women\u2019s Cricket team today are not only a promising outfit, but a potential world rival.\n\n\n\nRoad to ICC Women\u2019s World Cup 2025\n\n\n\nBy winning this series, India have proved them the best with this as the last leg of their preparation to the ICC Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup 2025, which will be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka between September 30 and November 2. There will be 8 teams in the World Cup and the 31 matches will be held in 5 different places in Guwahati, Vishakhapatnam, Indore, Bengaluru, and Colombo. As hosts, India will play all the league matches at home. The final will be played either in Bengaluru or Colombo.\n\n\n\nThis tour to England has solved some of the important questions before the mega event:\n\n\n\n\nHarmanpreet and Mandhana are at their best.\n\n\n\nThe middle-order, now featuring Jemimah Rodrigues and Deepti Sharma, is maturing up.\n\n\n\nThe bowling attack and the pace department of India is no longer dependent on a couple of names.\n\n\n\nThe spin department which is headed by Shreyanka Patil and Radha Yadav is still showing its supremacy in the sub-continental conditions.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the favourites of the upcoming ICC tournament is India besides Australia and England. Their first World Cup win could no longer be a far-fetched dream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Women Triumph in England: A Landmark Tour Fuels World Cup Hopes\n\n\n\nIndian women did not only win the matches, but they won our affection and inspired our faith in them and totally transformed the way we perceive the game. Through the cold mornings in the Lord in London to the nail-biting finishes in Manchester, this team had grit, grace and just plain guts. The clock is already ticking to the ICC Women World Cup 2025 and the Women in Blue are gearing up to make their presence felt on the grandest stage of them all.\n",

      "content_full": "\nCricket is often known as the \u2018Gentleman\u2019s game\u2019, and while an optimist may see that as an embodiment of the lofty set of ideals known as the \u2018spirit of cricket\u2019, one cannot look past the colonial connotations of the \u2018Gentleman\u2019s game\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe inception of cricket as a symbol of modernity and civilisation, led to the isolated nature of the sport. Its global spread was impeded by the ICC(then Imperial Cricket Conference) limiting the sport only to commonwealth nations. This led to the \u2018test status\u2019 culture which still restricts newer cricket nations from playing test cricket, as test status can only be bestowed by the ICC.\n\n\n\nTest Status\n\n\n\nCricket Nations have to be given access to test cricket by the ICC, the criteria of which has never been strictly laid out. There are no given number of matches or any ranking that a cricket nation has to reach in other formats rankings in order to be given \u2018test status\u2019. It is completely arbitrary upto the ICC and their own confidential qualification criteria.\n\n\n\nThis essentially furthers the concept of the \u2018gentleman\u2019s club\u2019 culture of cricket, where Britain essentially got to decide who played the sport and who did not. They had the entire control of the sport, its narrative and its spread. This significantly slowed down the spread of cricket across the globe and even killed off existing cricketing cultures that were not sustained or supported by the ICC.\n\n\n\nThe spread of t20 cricket\n\n\n\nWhile test cricket is still run almost like a gentleman\u2019s club, the shortest format of the game employs a much more global approach to the game. While the ODI world cup has shortened the list of teams playing in the tournament, the t20 world cup has kept increasing the number of teams playing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYearsNo. of teams2007-2012122014-22162024-present20\n\n\n\nItaly was a country which always had cricket in their culture. World famous football clubs such as AC Milan was once known as the Milan Cricket and Football Club and Genoa CFC(which stands for Genoa Cricket and Football club), but cricket slowly lost its appeal. Today Italy, has once again reentered cricket, this time through the European qualifier for their first chance to play in a World Cup.\n\n\n\nThe 2024 T20 World cup saw Canada and Uganda playing a World Cup for the first time. The addition of teams, along with region based qualifiers have allowed the T20 World Cup to become the primary vehicle of spreading and growing the sport. The last T20 World Cup was hosted by the USA, a method of spreading the popularity of the Sport in the United States. With USA playing cricket quite regularly in the T20 World Cups and the inception of the MLC(Major League Cricket), Cricket had once again found a place in the culture of the United States.\n\n\n\nAfghanistan, who first qualified for the 2010 T20 World Cup, made it to the semis in the 2024 edition exhibiting how a cricket nation can progress even through a short period of time. The dominance of the Big Three has led to inequality of revenue distribution when it comes to cricket. Nations like West Indies can\u2019t afford to keep their talented players in the national system anymore, the recent retirement of Nicholas Pooran being a perfect example of that.\n\n\n\nNations such as Zimbabwe or Kenya who had once achieved success on the international circuit, have since missed out on ODI World Cups( with the number of teams being reduced). The financial inequality within the sport has led to such scenarios where cricketing nations of former glory have fallen out of success and are unsuccessful at breeding future talent.\n\n\n\nFranchise leagues: A double edged sword\n\n\n\nFranchise cricket has revolutionised global cricket. (Photo credit: businessline)\n\n\n\nFranchise t20 cricket has been an equal exponent of democratising the sport. After the success of the IPL, franchise leagues overtook cricket and are now even enticing players away from the international circuit into full time franchise cricketers, playing for different teams across the globe.\n\n\n\nThe recent retirements of Heinrich Klaasen and Nicholas Pooran ahead of the t20 World Cup is a clear statement that these players would rather only play Franchise cricket rather than the international game. This mainly results from disagreements between players and their cricket boards. Most players only want to play ICC white ball tournaments along with Franchise cricket, while cricket boards look to play their valuable players in bilateral series which usually clashes with franchise leagues around the world.\n\n\n\nAlthough Franchise cricket has enticed talented players away from the international circuit, it has also given players from less prominent teams such as Rashid Khan or Sikandar Raza blockbuster careers and varied success across the cricketing world. Franchise cricket has spread the game across the globe and helped attract players from smaller cricketing nations to the franchise cricket structure, which has in turn reinforced and boosted their national teams to the forefront.\n\n\n\nConclusion: A way forward\n\n\n\nItaly\u2019s success reminds us that even through the problems that plague cricket, nations can still knock down the door when given opportunities. The inefficiency of the ICC and unequal financial distribution with cricket restricts the sport and its spread. There is no central authority in global cricket which results in most of the problems that plague the sport and its spread.\n\n\n\nThe shortest format of the game has been far more successful at globalising and democratising the sport. While test cricket continues to be fenced behind an arbitrary set of barriers, t20 cricket captures the spirit of the game and allows it to flourish throughout the globe, both through associate cricket and franchise cricket.\n",

      "content_full": "\nWhen Virat Kohli announced he would be missing the India vs England Test series \u2014 citing personal reasons that many speculated might be his quiet retirement from Tests \u2014 it was more than just a lineup change. It was the withdrawal of a heartbeat. In a series that saw India falter under pressure and England surge with Bazball confidence, the Kohli-shaped hole in the Indian middle order\u2014and in the team\u2019s psyche\u2014proved too large to patch.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just about losing a batter. It was about losing a force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. The Middle-Order Collapse: Where Kohli Would\u2019ve Held the Fort\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s where Kohli\u2019s stats speak loudest:\n\n\n\n\nIn Tests since 2018, Kohli has averaged 54.1 in home conditions.\n\n\n\nAgainst England in particular, he has scored 1,978 runs in Tests at an average of 48.24, including five centuries.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s also faced more deliveries per innings than any other Indian middle-order batter since 2016 \u2014 a statistic that reflects his ability to anchor when collapses threaten.\n\n\n\n\nIn the absence of that anchor, India\u2019s younger batters like Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer looked promising, but lacked the temperament to absorb pressure. Kohli doesn\u2019t just bat \u2014 he absorbs the storm and dares bowlers to break him. That mentality was sorely missed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Leadership by Presence, Even Without the Armband\n\n\n\nThough Rohit Sharma led the side, Kohli has long been the emotional engine of India\u2019s red-ball cricket. His presence brings intensity to the field \u2014 in the slips, in team huddles, even during DRS calls. He challenges teammates to rise to the occasion.\n\n\n\nMore than tactics, Kohli\u2019s on-field persona is infectious. Bowlers respond to his energy. Young players find courage in his belief. The loss of that charisma may not show in the scoreboard, but it does in body language. During Day 4 of the final Test, as England piled on pressure, India looked unusually flat. Would Kohli have let heads drop so early? Highly unlikely.\n\n\n\n3. Bazball Needed a Combatant, Not Just a Bowler\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s new-age attacking style \u2014 \u201cBazball\u201d \u2014 thrives when opponents become reactive. Kohli is the antithesis of reactive. His confrontational, counter-punching nature would\u2019ve matched the aggression head-on.\n\n\n\nImagine this: Joe Root reverse scooping Bumrah for four. Jonny Bairstow slog-sweeping Ashwin into the stands. These are moments when a senior voice \u2014 loud, deliberate, fearless \u2014 becomes essential. Kohli has been that voice in the past. Without him, India lacked that emotional match to England\u2019s bravado.\n\n\n\n4. The Mental Edge Was England\u2019s\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum entered the series with a swagger that needed to be checked early. Kohli\u2019s competitive aura has historically rattled England, most notably during the 2018 and 2021 series. He takes personal pride in playing them.\n\n\n\nWithout Kohli, the psychological war tilted toward England. They weren\u2019t challenged mentally in the same way. India\u2019s on-field chatter was subdued. Their celebrations less intense. Cricket is a mental game as much as it is a technical one \u2014 and Kohli is one of its greatest mind warriors.\n\n\n\n5. Off the Field: Kohli the Magnet\n\n\n\nEven when he\u2019s not scoring, Kohli draws focus, absorbs pressure from teammates, and dominates opposition planning. Every team has a plan for Kohli. With him out, England focused on dismantling a relatively inexperienced middle order and exposing the lower half. Their short-ball tactics against Iyer, and clever spin to trap Gill, wouldn\u2019t have worked as cleanly had Kohli stood firm at No. 4.\n\n\n\nFrom a media perspective, Kohli also controls the narrative. His post-match pressers, his body language \u2014 they send messages to fans and critics alike. His absence meant that void was filled by silence or speculation \u2014 neither of which helped the Indian dressing room environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: A Loss Bigger Than Runs\n\n\n\nIndia may have had the talent to challenge England, but what they missed was presence \u2014 Virat Kohli\u2019s burning desire to dominate, his ability to control tempo, absorb pressure, and drag a team across the finish line even when things looked bleak.\n\n\n\nRetirement \u2014 or even temporary absence \u2014 from a player like Kohli doesn\u2019t just impact a scorecard. It changes the energy of an entire team.\n\n\n\nAnd in a five-day chess match like Test cricket, sometimes, that energy is everything.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe world is getting riled up with a new proposal to overhaul the football regulations. The International Football Association Board (IFAB) the people who draft the law are considering a radical overhaul of the major rules of the game particularly the penalties. They want to make everything more equal, quicker, and more thrilling in the modern matches. The 2026 World Cup might become the tournament when these changes go live in case all goes well.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at the changes that were made:\n\n\n\n1. VAR Power Extension\n\n\n\nIn order to confirm or suggest a decision change, VAR consults with the on-field referee after reviewing video footage of significant situations. Extending the reach of VAR intervention is the subject is a significant proposal that was made by IFAB.\n\n\n\nAs Football lawmakers ponder more drastic reforms in football laws, VAR reviews for second yellow cards and corners may be introduced, and corner kicks may be submitted to VAR examination for \u201cclear and obvious errors.\u201d, to ensure realistic decision changes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetizens and supporters are of the perception that through these changes, the accuracy of decision making in critical situations will be enhanced. Meanwhile, the critics of the attempts caution that adding it may extend the matches further, which are already being pressured by added time and reviews.\n\n\n\n2. One shot, One outcome: Proposal to bring changes in Penalty\n\n\n\nAnother controversial rule change proposal is to bring changes to Penalty Shoot. Previously, there was a chance for another attempt after rebound, but the propsal to bring new changes say-\n\n\n\nOnce a spot\u2011kick is taken:\n\n\n\n\nIf it goes in, kick-off will happen right away.\n\n\n\nThere is no second opportunity from rebounds if it is missed or saved, hence it is a goal-kick.\n\n\n\n\nRemoving rebounds from penalty kicks entirely is one of the most contentious new concepts being discussed. The reform\u2019s proponents believe it will streamline possession enforcement and cut down on the drawn-out VAR discussion. However, critics caution that these adjustments would eliminate historical unpredictability and drama from the football story, but netizens see the reform as a way to simplify possession enforcement and reduce the long VAR debate. \n\n\n\nAt least 6 votes are needed for any adoption, and it is being held in time for potential ratification of the 2026  World Cup. To enhance the game before the inaugural 48-team World Cup, world chiefs are discussing potential legal changes at the highest levels. \n\n\n\n3. A maximum time of 8 seconds: Restrictions on Goalkeeper\n\n\n\nGoalkeepers are now only allowed to hold a ball for mostly 8 seconds. The existing penalty of an indirect free kick will be replaced with a corner kick for the opposition team if the limit is surpassed. The reason to bring this change is to promote constant play without any distraction and to get rid of any time wastage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. More precise possession rules: For ball dropping situations\n\n\n\nThe IFAB has made it clear that if one team had clear possession when play was halted and the ball was outside the penalty area, they will keep possession when play resumes in order to remove any confusion during ball drop restarts. The team that most recently touched the ball will be awarded the ball if possession is not clear.\n\n\n\n5. Changes in VAR communication: Officials may speak to the audience\n\n\n\nAnother proposal to bring change in football laws is similar to the NFL, where competitions will also be given the opportunity for referees to audibly explain VAR decisions to spectators, increasing transparency. Nevertheless, based on their own rules and regulations, leagues may also decide to keep these communications confidential.\n\n\n\n6. External contact: No cards for unintentional disruption\n\n\n\nThe restart will merely be an indirect free kick to the opposition if a coach, substitute, or even a player who was ejected inadvertently touches the ball outside the field of play. No disciplinary action will be taken; this regulation is intended to prevent excessive punishment for innocuous, unintentional situations.\n\n\n\n7. Another big change in football laws: Double touch during penalty kicks has been revised\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the new rules, if the penalty taker accidentally touches the ball with both of his foot, the goal will not be disallowed and the penalty will be retaken. This change is after the issues about the games having been controversial, as in the case of Juli\u00e1n Alvarez having his goal disallowed in the match played between Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Real Madrid.\n\n\n\n8. Positioning of the assistant referee: in line with the penalty spot\n\n\n\nDuring assessing tight offside calls and goal-line rulings, from now assistant referees will line up with the penalty spot instead of the goal line. This modification intends to increase overall decision-making accuracy and better align with VAR technology.\n\n\n\nFew additional innovations in the Club World Cup:\n\n\n\nOne of the most-hyped innovations will be referee body cameras, which will be used in the Club World Cup. Through making the fans look into the game with an experience in real time, and through the perspective of a referee, this unique project would like to raise the level of transparency and predisposition towards the judgment made on the field to be more acceptable. \n\n\n\nOnly the team captains will get the permission to talk with a referee in specific circumstances, to promote respect for match officials.   \n\n\n\nAhead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and beyond, these suggestions for changes to some football laws show a desire to boldly modernize football. In order for these drastic changes to formally become a part of football\u2019s future, supporters and interested parties await the IFAB vote next year. With these proposals to bring changes in football laws, the world of football will be attentively observing how the beautiful game develops in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nAs Borussia Dortmund prepared for their second Club World Cup group stage clash at TQL Stadium, Gio Reyna wasn\u2019t on the field. He wasn\u2019t even on the bench. He was in the locker room with the rest of the unused players and this image was shared on social media just a few minutes after the whistle and it went like a bushfire on both sides of the Atlantic. The scene was too vivid to be disregarded by a once-promised American prospect.\n\n\n\nReyna is not just stalling in her career but he is on a very dangerous path of becoming irrelevant. And with transfer talks now in full swing, the question is no longer if he should move, but where. He has an option to earn up to a potential 6.95 million to move to Serie A team Parma or even links to MLS with LAFC and NYCFC and the choice he makes can be the beginning of the next ten years of his career. In my opinion, the answer is obvious: Major League Soccer is the only place where Reyna can restore his game and image.\n\n\n\nThe Decline of a Prodigy\n\n\n\nReyna\u2019s fall didn\u2019t start this week or this summer. It got started around the period of the 2022 World Cup, where he only featured 52 minutes of the game, with rumors of him having a bad training attitude and there being a vote to see whether he should even be retained by the team. The controversy was further intensified with the family drama that ensued. At his club team, Reyna is yet to live up to the hype but he has been solid with the U.S. national team. One of them was the Golden Ball of the Nations League 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Dortmund, Reyna played just 341 minutes of football in the 2024-25 season. His loan to Nottingham Forest produced just one goal contribution in 10 games. Since 2021, he\u2019s battled at least eight muscular injuries, missing over 80 matches, including recurring right hamstring issues. At the Club World Cup, Reyna ranked as the 19th-fastest player on the team, behind goalkeeper Gregor Kobel.\n\n\n\nWhy Does MLS Make More Sense Than Serie A?\n\n\n\nThe offer from Parma of 6 million euros, including bonuses, is a good offer to Reyna due to his few minutes of play and injury. The three-year contract with a release clause of 25 million euros is evidence that the club is ready to support his potential in the future. But Serie A, and particularly a lower-table team like Parma (16th in 2024\u201325), may not offer Reyna the patient, flexible environment he needs.\n\n\n\nUnder new coach Carlos Cuesta, Parma is entering a high-pressure rebuild. Reyna, with fitness and defensive issues (he is in the 1st percentile in terms of interceptions, 15th in tackles and 32nd in blocks among attacking mids globally, by FBRef), might struggle in a physically demanding league like Serie A.\n\n\n\nBy comparison, MLS gives him room to operate. The league often puts a premium on offensive upside, even if it comes without much defensive effort. A good example is Riqui Puig; he has registered excellent goal and assist statistics and he has not spent as much time preventing attacks. MLS has yet to fall out of love with the creative No. 10 talents and that is exactly what Reyna is.\n\n\n\nIn case he transfers to a team like NYCFC or LAFC, Reyna might directly enter the starting eleven, become the go-to star, and, last but not least, play regular minutes. The only thing he would need to continue doing is to sharpen what he does best: vision, creativity and flawless technique.\n\n\n\nA wonderful opportunity for the club and country\n\n\n\nThe U.S. men\u2019s national team doesn\u2019t have a single American playing in MLS who qualifies as a marquee global draw. MLS, for all its progress, still lacks a homegrown star who headlines every week and brings fans to stadiums on name alone. Reyna, at 22, still has the talent to be that player.\n\n\n\nFrom the league\u2019s perspective, bringing Reyna home could help balance the one-way export pipeline. From Reyna\u2019s perspective, MLS offers more than minutes\u2014it offers relevance, responsibility, and rehabilitation. It offers a fresh start with meaning.\n\n\n\nFinal Words\n\n\n\nIt seems that Serie A will be a challenging match and Parma does have a strategy. Nevertheless, Gio Reyna, the midfielder of New York City FC, does not require another tactical slog or an uphill battle to remain relevant in Europe. Minutes, confidence, and a stage that will allow Reyna to be what he is\u2014an intuitive maker, a peculiar visionary with a sense of style\u2014are all Reyna requires.\n\n\n\nMLS provides him with that. Not a step down, but an opportunity to take a step forward. Home injured, fit, center-stage and a reminder as to why he was the most exciting American talent since Pulisic. And we can be too forgetful of the ripple effect. MLS requires a homegrown, transcendent American-made star. Reyna has the potential to become that face, should he rise to the task.\n",

      "content_full": "\nWhen Italy made history by qualifying for the 2026 ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup, it was more than a landmark moment for them. It was yet another indication that the balance of global cricket is changing. Traditionally viewed as outsiders to the sport, Italy\u2019s progress is part of a larger trend of associates breaking through internationally.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2024 T20 World Cup, co-hosted by the USA and the West Indies, we saw the potential of associate nations. The USA\u2019s famous victory in the Super Over against a full ICC member, Pakistan, sent shockwaves through cricketing circles. At the same time, Scotland and the Netherlands pushed the giants of cricket to the brink, with the Netherlands beating Bangladesh and announcing to the world their talent.\n\n\n\nThese aren\u2019t flukes but the culmination of years of steady growth, ICC support, and a simple desire to show that cricket is not just a game that belongs to its traditional heartlands. With a growing number of pathways to qualification and opportunities to play in a professional environment, associate nations aren\u2019t just minnows; they are rewriting the game.\n\n\n\nThe ICC is opening the door\n\n\n\nCricket is no longer limited to Full Member nations, which is a good thing. The ICC is taking this task seriously by introducing a plan to promote expansion into non-cricketing nations. They are also restructuring the game globally to build inclusivity and development for associate nations.\n\n\n\nOne of these changes in restructuring has been the implementation of a 20-team T20 World Cup, which has provided more associate sides with a legitimate chance at a global stage. While introducing performance qualification pathways and funding-linkage for developed nations in associate countries, sports are providing access to emerging nations to profit on merit, not legacy.\n\n\n\nWith the possibility of cricket returning to the Olympics for Los Angeles 2028, the ICC\u2019s vision is clear in terms of globalizing sports outside its traditional framework. These plans are more than just token gestures; they are fundamentally changing the balance of power in terms of international cricket and allowing associate nations to create their own narrative. It is not only a wider playing field but finally a more level playing field.\n\n\n\nGame-changing moments: Associate nations shattering the giants\n\n\n\nAssociate nations have created some of cricket\u2019s most epic moments in recent history and have genuinely started to carve a niche for themselves. The understanding has always been that when they play teams in the upper echelons of the game, the result will be one-sided. Yet, they clamored their way to proving the crowds wrong.\n\n\n\nIn the 2024 T20 World Cup, the USA shocked Pakistan with a super over win, and the Netherlands bested Bangladesh after convincing victories against both South Africa and Zimbabwe, while Scotland and Namibia also proved their capabilities under pressure.\n\n\n\nThese results show that there has been foresight, hunger, and a desire from the players. Associate Nations are not only there to participate but also to play as competitive teams against Full Members. We are witnessing moments of change in the scene of cricket, where \u2018minnows\u2019 are transitioning to emerging attractions of their own.\n\n\n\nEmerging nations: Dawn of a new era\n\n\n\nWhile several associate nations are currently making a name for themselves, others are on the precipice of breaking through. Nepal has developed a culture for cricket as established as those in Test-playing countries, with record attendance numbers at home.\n\n\n\nUganda\u2019s spirited run at the 2024 T20 World Cup had everyone talking about the potential of this team, which played hard and showed promise. Germany is quietly positioning itself in Europe by utilizing immigrant communities and a growing domestic structure, creating a place for cricket. Canada is back at ICC events with a new generation of innovative cricketers ready to play.\n\n\n\nThese emerging teams are not just placeholders; they are laying the groundwork for long-term development. There\u2019s sustained investment, structured youth programs, and an opportunity for global exposure. These countries represent the next group of associate challengers, and they come prepared and ready to take their seats. The future of cricket is not only in established stadiums but also in the dynamism and aspirations of countries where cricket is still taking root.\n\n\n\nT20 Leagues: The catalyst in the growth of associate nations\n\n\n\nIn addition to the ICC policy, franchise T20 growth from an associate nation standpoint is one of the major catalysts for growth and progress. The expansion of franchise T20 leagues, like the CPL, MLC, and ILT20, is vital to associate nations because it helps players like Ali Khan from the US and Lamichhane from Nepal gain experience.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, immigrant communities, especially those from South Asia, the Caribbean, and Africa, are creating interest and investment in cricket throughout North America, Europe, and the Gulf. For instance, Italy, the other associate participant in the 2023 Cricket World Cup, qualified through a multicultural team with South Asian and Caribbean backgrounds.\n\n\n\nThese communities are creating talent pools and fan bases, bringing sponsorship and media visibility. In summary, associate cricket is not developing in isolation. It is plugged into a global cricketing economy where opportunity travels as quickly as a six over midwicket.\n\n\n\nThe way forward: From minnows to stakeholders\n\n\n\nAssociates need more than inspiration to become consistent; they need infrastructure, investment, and inclusion. Regular bilateral series with full members are critical for teams like Namibia, Scotland, and the Netherlands to develop.\n\n\n\nWe need to create domestic competitions for these nations, as it is a level where we can increase our investment. Change is certainly happening with an increasing number of players paid professionally, an increasing investment into development, and upgrades in coaching and governance.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of positive signals. With more ICC support along with local leadership, associates can truly become stakeholders in the long-term future of cricket. If cricket wants to be a global game, then associate cricket needs to be seen as integral and not an afterthought.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nFounded in 1888 by Sir Henry Mortimer Durand in Shimla (then Simla), the Durand Cup, originally known as the Shimla Trophy or the Durand Football Tournament, is Asia\u2019s oldest and the world\u2019s third-oldest football competition, after England\u2019s FA Cup (1871) and the Scottish Cup (1873). It began as an inter-regimental event for British Indian Army units, designed to promote physical fitness and camaraderie among troops. The inaugural final saw Royal Scots Fusiliers defeat Highland Light Infantry 2\u20131, marking the beginning of what would become a symbol of footballing heritage in India.\n\n\n\nInitially a military-exclusive tournament, the competition was held annually in Shimla and gained prominence as a major sporting event in colonial India. Over time, it began inviting civilian clubs, most notably from the 1920s onward, transitioning from a regimental tradition into a bridge between colonial sport and the rise of Indian club football. The Durand Cup\u2019s evolution laid the foundation for India\u2019s footballing culture, making it one of the most emotionally cherished tournaments among players, clubs, and fans to this day.\n\n\n\nFrom Army Greens to Civilian Glory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1925, Mohun Bagan became the first civilian, all-Indian team invited to compete among British regiments. A landmark moment followed in 1940 when Mohammedan Sporting broke the 50\u2011year British monopoly, beating the Royal Warwickshire Regiment to become the first civilian champions.\n\n\n\nAfter independence, governance transferred to the Durand Football Tournament Society (DFTS) in 1947, under the leadership of India\u2019s Defence Secretary and Service Chiefs. The first post\u2011independence winner in 1950 was Hyderabad City Police under coach Syed Abdul Rahim, defeating Mohun Bagan in a replayed final.\n\n\n\nSource: Durandcup.in\n\n\n\nLegacy in Silverware: Clubs That Built the Myth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver decades, the tournament has been dominated by Kolkata giants: Mohun Bagan leads the chart with 17 titles, followed closely by East Bengal with 16. Historic twin three\u2011peat runs include Mohun Bagan (1964-66, 1984-86) and East Bengal (1989-91).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe winner still receives three trophies annually: the Durand Cup, the Shimla Trophy (both rolling), and the President\u2019s Cup (a permanent trophy introduced by President Dr. Rajendra Prasad).\n\n\n\nSource: Thebridge.in\n\n\n\nA Catalyst for Indian Football Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Durand Cup became a proving ground for many of India\u2019s football icons. Chuni Goswami, P.K. Banerjee, Baichung Bhutia, I.M. Vijayan, and Sunil Chhetri all cut their teeth here. Sunil Chhetri himself has called it \u201ca springboard\u201d to national recognition.\n\n\n\nIts high-pressure matches and rivalries helped elevate Indian football in the 1950s, culminating in India\u2019s remarkable fourth\u2011place finish at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, powered by players hardened in Durand\u2019s heat.\n\n\n\nSource: Sportsdigest\n\n\n\nRekindling the Flame: Revival in the Modern Era\n\n\n\nBy the mid\u20112000s, the emergence of ISL and the Super Cup overshadowed the Durand Cup, and many ISL clubs either skipped it or sent second teams. Between 2015 and 2018, only minimalist editions took place.\n\n\n\nThe tide turned in 2019, when God\u2019s own Kerala club Gokulam Kerala FC beat multiple ISL and Kolkata giants to lift the trophy in Kolkata, signaling a promising revival. Since then:\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Durand was officially designated the season opener of Indian football, conducted under Eastern Command in the football\u2011mad city of Kolkata.\n\n\n\nIn 2022 (131st edition), all ISL clubs were mandated to participate, joined by I\u2011League and Armed Forces teams, expanding to multiple cities (Kolkata, Guwahati, and Imphal) in a 20\u2011team format with 47 matches and 133 goals scored.

With two spots in the final on the line, excitement is high among fans and analysts.\n\n\n\nSemi-Final 1: England vs Italy\n\n\n\nDate: 23rd JulyTime: 12:30 AM ISTLive on FanCode\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s Lionesses, the reigning champions from Euro 2022, are full of confidence after completing a flawless group stage. They recently secured a thrilling penalty shootout victory over Sweden (3-2). Under manager Sarina Wiegman, England has remained unbeaten since the group stage loss to France.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s Key Players to Watch\n\n\n\n\nLauren James: The Chelsea forward has been outstanding on the wings, scoring 3 goals and assisting 2 so far. Her connection with Ella Toone has been crucial in breaking down tight defenses.\n\n\n\nMillie Bright: The center-back has been solid in England\u2019s defense, winning 78% of her aerial duels.\n\n\n\n\nItaly, on the other hand, surprised many by reaching their first Euro semi-final since 1997. Their strong quarterfinal win over Norway (2-1) has given Andrea Soncin\u2019s team added momentum, showcasing a blend of youth and resilience.\n\n\n\nItaly\u2019s Key Players to Watch\n\n\n\n\nCristiana Girelli: With 4 goals in the tournament, the Juventus striker is Italy\u2019s biggest threat.\n\n\n\nManuela Giugliano: The AS Roma midfielder has set the pace and completed the most pressured passes (158) among Italian players.\n\n\n\n\nHead-to-Head:\n\n\n\n\nTotal Meetings: 32\n\n\n\nEngland Wins: 12\n\n\n\nItaly Wins: 14\n\n\n\nDraws: 6\n\n\n\n\nTheir last meeting in February 2024 ended with England defeating Italy 5-1 in a one-sided friendly.\n\n\n\nSemi-Final 2: Germany vs Spain\n\n\n\nDate: 24th JulyTime: 12:30 AM ISTLive on FanCode\n\n\n\nGermany, eight-time Euro champions, have been sharp in their quest for glory. After a disappointing exit in 2022, they have adjusted their strategy under coach Christian W\u00fcck. Their intense penalty shootout win over France (6-5) in the quarterfinals displayed a mix of power and style.\n\n\n\nKey Players to Watch:\n\n\n\n\nAnn-Katrin Berger: The experienced Chelsea goalkeeper has played a key role in Germany\u2019s strong defensive showings. With an 85% saving rate this tournament, Berger\u2019s reflexes and leadership are vital, especially during set pieces and penalty situations.\n\n\n\nJule Brand: The agile midfielder has been Germany\u2019s creative force in transition. Averaging 2.4 key passes per game and completing 87% of her passes, Brand\u2019s dribbling and flair in tight spaces make her a consistent threat near the opponent\u2019s box.\n\n\n\n\nSpain, the current FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup champions, have brought their signature style to Switzerland. They defeated ten-player Switzerland 2-0 in the quarterfinals with their effective passing tactics and pressing strategy.\n\n\n\nKey Players to Watch:\n\n\n\n\nAitana Bonmat\u00ed: The 2023 Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin winner has excelled creatively with 4 assists and 23 key passes in the tournament.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlexia Putellas: The two-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner and Spain\u2019s midfield leader is regaining her top form. Her skill in controlling the pace, holding possession, and delivering precise through balls has made her central to Spain\u2019s play. Putellas has created 16 chances and completed over 90% of her passes in the opponent\u2019s half, highlighting her vision and poise under pressure.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHead-to-Head:\n\n\n\n\nTotal Meetings: 8\n\n\n\nGermany Wins: 5\n\n\n\nSpain Wins: 0\n\n\n\nDraws: 3\n\n\n\n\nGermany won their last match against Spain 1-0 during the 2024 Summer Olympics, with Spain still seeking their first victory against them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoad to the Final\n\n\n\nAll four teams exhibit unique strengths:\n\n\n\n\nEngland: Well-organized build-up and skilled set pieces.\n\n\n\nItaly: Strong defense and sharp counterattacks.\n\n\n\nGermany: Aerial strength and offensive overloads.\n\n\n\nSpain: Focused on possession with adaptable positioning.\n\n\n\n\nThe final will take place on 27th July at 9:30 PM IST, also live on FanCode. The tournament\u2019s top scorer and best player awards will be announced after the final.\n\n\n\nTactical Trends & Stats\n\n\n\nAccording to UEFA\u2019s official technical report, the tournament has seen:\n\n\n\n\nAverage Possession: Spain leads with 68.8%.\n\n\n\nMost Goals by a Team: Spain (16 goals)\n\n\n\nGoals Scored So Far: 100 (3.58 per match).\n\n\n\nMost Clean Sheets: Spain & Sweden (2).\n\n\n\nTop Scorer: Esther Gonz\u00e1lez (4 goals).\n\n\n\nMost Assists: Alexia Putellas (4 assists).\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s at Stake?\n\n\n\nFor England, winning back-to-back Euro titles would solidify their success. For Italy, reaching the final would represent their biggest achievement in women\u2019s football in years.

      "content_full": "\nThe Anderson-Tendulkar trophy is more than halfway done. The looming questions that people had about a new Indian side and how they will fare against Bazball at home have been answered to some extent. There has been fantastic cricket played by both sides upto this point in the series. This is a report of the test series, three matches in and a look at what each of these teams has done well and poorly through the three test matches.\n\n\n\nFirst Test: Headingley\n\n\n\nThe first test was played on a pitch that heavily favored batting, on which batting got easier as the match progressed. Both teams fared pretty equally, with exceptional batting by England in the fourth innings, which sealed the game.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Recap\n\n\n\nIndia fared well with the bat throughout the game owing to Rishabh Pant\u2019s twin tons. There were three other centurions from India. The lower middle order and the tail were blown out by England in both innings with lower-order collapses.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s bowling looked toothless other than Jasprit Bumrah and they couldn\u2019t get the tail out efficiently, leaking runs to England\u2019s lower order. The lack of support for Bumrah can be traced to the mismanagement of bowling resources by the Indian team, as Shardul Thakur, who is predominantly a swing bowler, was barely bowled when the ball was new.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s Recap\n\n\n\nWith the bat, England was plagued only by Jasprit Bumrah in the first innings. While India\u2019s batting was top-order intensive, with England the entire batting order pitched in with useful runs to bring up a par total in the first innings. The second innings saw them pull off their second biggest chase smoothly, in classic Bazball fashion.\n\n\n\nWith the ball, England failed to make early inroads in both innings. Stokes was their best bowler by far, but Josh Tongue wiped off the tail efficiently in both innings, which helped England keep India to a manageable total that they could chase down.\n\n\n\nSecond Test: Edgbaston\n\n\n\nShubman Gill showed the world his potential with the bat. (Photo credit: ESPNCricinfo)\n\n\n\nThe second test continued the trend of flat pitches in the series. Shubman Gill touched new heights in this test match and Akash Deep took 4 wickets in the first and 6 in the second, for a match total of 10 wickets.\n\n\n\nIndian Team Performance\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s batting continued to dominate England\u2019s bowling in this match. Shubman Gill notched up 269 in the first innings and 161 in the second innings, almost batting England out single-handedly. The new Indian top order had proved that they were more than adept at making large scores and batting out test matches.\n\n\n\nWith the ball, India was the superior team in every count in this test match. In both innings, India bowled well with the new ball, making cracks in the England batting lineup. The pitch offered no help to the bowlers other than with the new ball, and even without Bumrah, India, helped by Akash Deep and Siraj, sealed the deal by knocking out England for 271 in the fourth innings.\n\n\n\nEngland Team Performance\n\n\n\nThe only thing that worked out for England\u2019s batting was Harry Brook and Jamie Smith in the first innings with their 303-run stand, which rescued England from an early collapse. Jamie Smith also hit an impressive 88 in the second innings for England. It was a poor showing for the English batsmen as they failed to counteract the Indian new ball bowling attack between Siraj and Akash Deep.\n\n\n\nEngland failed to contain India\u2019s run-scoring fest with the ball and looked almost clueless on how to get wickets on the flat pitch of Edgbaston. The English bowling attack in both of the tests didn\u2019t have any answers against the Indian top order, and with India bolstering their lower order in the second test, England failed to blow off the tail as well.\n\n\n\nThird test: Lords\n\n\n\nThe third test at Lords was by far the closest affair in the series. It was the narrowest margin by which England has won at Lords, which was a thriller on a slow, dying pitch at Lords where both scoring quickly and taking wickets proved to be tough.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Performance\n\n\n\nIn the first innings, Rahul and Pant\u2019s partnership was looking to take the match away from England when a lapse in concentration before lunch led to Pant being run out with him trying to ensure KL Rahul got to his 100 before lunch. Shortly after, KL Rahul was also dismissed on 100. These two dismissals proved to be crucial for England, as they had manufactured two important wickets that restricted India to 387 in the first innings. Jadeja also added valuable runs after Rahul and Pant\u2019s partnership was broken by the runout.\n\n\n\nThe second innings was lost by India in two sessions, the last session of day 4 and the first session of day 5. Two collapses in two sessions led to India being 82-7 in the first session. Although Jadeja tried to salvage India\u2019s innings, it proved to be too tough a task for the tailenders to chase down 193 in the fourth innings.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s bowling effort combined with the pitch forced England to score slowly (the slowest run rate in their Bazball era); Bumrah\u2019s five-for restricted England to 387. The second innings saw the rest of the Indian bowling attack finally support Bumrah, with Washington\u2019s standout spell taking 4 wickets on a dying pitch and restricting England to 192.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s Performance\n\n\n\nEngland perfectly adapted to the conditions of the match and slowed down their Bazball approach accordingly. Joe Root brought up a brilliantly paced century to bring up a par total for England. Jamie Smith brought up another 50, continuing his brilliant run of form.\n\n\n\nIn the bowling department, Stokes walked through fire to bring England home in the Lord\u2019s test, while a returning Jofra proved to be his partner in crime, along with a brilliant spell by Carse late in Day 4, all of which contributed to England winning the third test by a narrow margin. England\u2019s bowling looked better in this test than over the entire series thus far; it remains to be seen whether they can keep up this bowling form over the next two matches.\n\n\n\nFinal Words\n\n\n\nThe stage is set for a scintillating finish to this test series, with the scoreline being a close 2-1. Will India bounce back and claim a rare away series win, or will England take advantage of their lead and close out the series in their favor? The entire cricketing world waits for these answers as we wait for the last 2 tests of this fantastic test series.\n\n\n\n\n",

Having that behind them, they travel to Manchester, where they have not lost a test since 2014 and have a good record.\n\n\n\nTwo of the largest stars in the country, Joe Root and Ben Stokes, are going to lead the side once again. Stokes is playing his 100th Test, and Root averages 48.58 against India in Tests and will be an important element in the lineup, along with Ollie Pope and Harry Brook in the middle order.\n\n\n\nEngland have also included Jofra Archer in their team, as he has been unable to play this season due to his elbow injury.

      "content_full": "\nMohammed Siraj is indefatigable, un-stoppable-the inspiration of the drive and persistence every fast bowler hopes to have get some years of his life in cricket. Since 2023, he has been a constant part of India\u2019s Test and ODI squads, tirelessly leading the attack across conditions in the absence of Bumrah. Except for his omission from the Champions Trophy squad, he has featured in nearly every major series.\n\n\n\nHe bowls with raw emotion, heart on his sleeve, and fire in his eyes. Whether it\u2019s the long spell in a test match at a flat pitch or the final spell of a grueling ODI, his intensity never fades. And yet, despite his unwavering commitment and crucial contributions, Siraj remains underpraised, a strong pillar of India\u2019s pace attack whose impact deserves far more attention than it receives.\n\n\n\nUnstoppable force across formats\n\n\n\nSince early 2023, Mohammed Siraj has emerged as one of India\u2019s most successful fast bowlers across all formats, particularly in Tests and ODIs. He has been a regular part of practically every playing XI, often being tasked with leading the attack in difficult foreign conditions and filling a gap when the team needed control, wickets, or energy. Siraj has done this in a variety of ways and at different paces, whether it is with a hard new ball or consistently bowling in long spells with an older ball.\n\n\n\nSiraj\u2019s contributions have been different from his counterparts since Bumrah is only available through management, and Shami is only available sometimes due to injuries. Siraj has not had any such breaks due to his consistent filling of roles with an unrivaled speed and sustainability. Siraj is India\u2019s obvious preferred option in times of transition and the absence of senior pacers.\n\n\n\nMost overs by pacers across formats (Since 2023)\n\n\n\nPlayersInningsOversWicketsP Cummins68871.3129M Starc75856.2137M Siraj79792.5117\n\n\n\nWhat has made him so reliant, however, is also contributing to his peril of burnout, given that he is constantly taken for granted by team management. Despite the physical and mental fatigue that the demands of all formats put on him, Siraj continues to create intensity and illustrate himself to be important within India\u2019s fast bowling ecology.\n\n\n\nBowling with heart: The fire that fuels him\n\n\n\nYou can question his aggression, but you\u2019d be foolish to dispute his love for the game. Siraj sends a message with each delivery. He puts his emotions on display and exhibits an emotional intensity every time he bowls. You can see the dedication and energy he put into every ball, every over, every spell, and every match.\n\n\n\nA pacer without aggression feels incomplete. There are many instances of Siraj revealing his aggressive side. The two most talked about are from BGT and the ongoing tour for India. He dismissed Head on a toe-crushing yorker and second when he gave a send-off to Duckett. These are the things that make cricket interesting. Players should have every right to celebrate moments like this.\n\n\n\nThat passion, combined with the effort, elevates him from being inconsequential, and he finds himself on the stage. His aggressive fast bowling ignites a passion with each wicket gained, and it is guided by the fire and emotion that stands above it all, which brings him through the rigors of all three formats of cricket.\n\n\n\nIgnored but indispensable\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s management of fast bowlers has generally revolved around rotation, especially with premium pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami. Siraj has hardly been part of this. Since 2023, he has played near-continuously across formats only to shoulder whatever weight others left behind due to rest or injury.\n\n\n\nHe has ironically remained overused because he could always be relied upon. Whenever injury comes knocking, he is the automatic call from their bench. No matter the conditions. No matter his fatigue. He has approached all conditions with the same trust, yet the trust did not equate to adequate management. In a system that claims to prioritize player welfare, Siraj is overexposed and underprotected.\n\n\n\nMost overs by Indian bowlers across formats (Since 2023)\n\n\n\nPlayersInningsOversWicketsR Jadeja81990129M Siraj79792.5117J Bumrah58646.5136R Ashwin3763993K Yadav64501.2109\n\n\n\nWhy Siraj deserves more credit\n\n\n\nFor all his energy and commitment, Mohammed Siraj is still underrated in the wider cricket conversation. He\u2019s not the first choice in the Indian pace department, but he makes a tangible impact. Whether charging in on a new ball or running in with a well-chewed old ball, Siraj puts everything he has into it, always.\n\n\n\nMost overs by Indian bowlers vs. England\n\n\n\nPlayerOversWicketsSiraj10913Bumrah86.412Akashdeep72.111Jadeja993\n\n\n\nBut the claps from the stands are quiet. Too often, someone else takes the spotlight, and Siraj is forgotten. His passionate intensity, match-turning spells, and performing well under pressure deserve more than incidental praise. Acknowledgment is not merely for the stars; it should also recognize workhorses like Siraj, who allow winning to happen.\n\n\n\n\n",

Fast forward to today, and he\u2019s become one of the driving forces behind Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s greatest season. Under the calm guidance of Luis Enrique, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has evolved into more than just a quick pair of feet on the wing. \n\n\n\nHe\u2019s matured mentally sharper, tactically aware, and is finally delivering when it matters most. In a season where PSG lifted their first-ever Champions League trophy, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 didn\u2019t just play a part; he defined it. This isn\u2019t a comeback story. It\u2019s the arrival of the player he was always meant to be.\n\n\n\nFrom Frustration in Barcelona to a New Chapter in Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 signed for FC Barcelona in 2017, he arrived with the weight of expectation. Tasked with replacing Neymar, his \u20ac105 million transfer was one of the most expensive in football history. But over the next six seasons, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s spell at Camp Nou was a mixture of electric potential and disappointing inconsistency. Plagued by repeated injuries and inconsistent form, he often found himself sidelined\u2014both literally and figuratively.\n\n\n\nIn total, he made 153 La Liga appearances, scoring 34 goals and providing 34 assists, averaging around 0.22 goal involvements per match (FBref). His dribbling and flair never disappeared, but Barcelona\u2019s tactical rigidity often limited his impact. It became difficult to determine whether he was simply unlucky or if the environment at Bar\u00e7a failed to nurture his style of play.\n\n\n\nA Reunion and a Revival Under Luis Enrique\n\n\n\n\nNever forget this Luis Enrique talk to Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 about the importance of defending after PSG vs. Barcelona in the Champions League last season \ud83d\udc40After Saturday's UCL final, Enrique praised Ousmane Dembele for his defending and being a leader. pic.twitter.com/A2b3pHcROi\u2014 ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) June 2, 2025\n\n\n\n\nDemb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s move to Paris Saint-Germain in August 2023 reunited him with Luis Enrique, his former coach at Barcelona. Enrique\u2019s vision for Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was different. No longer just a right-winger stuck to the touchline, he was transformed into a central attacking threat roaming between the lines, exploiting half-spaces, and pressing with intent.\n\n\n\nThis switch in role allowed Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to become more influential than ever. Enrique gave him the freedom to drift inside, dictate tempo, and contribute to the build-up. He wasn\u2019t just an end-product player anymore; he was now involved in every phase of attack.\n\n\n\nWith PSG\u2019s tactical setup allowing for fluid front-line rotations, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 quickly became the centerpiece. Whether it was linking up with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, combining with Kang-in Lee, or pressing high to create turnovers, his evolution into a modern forward was stunning.\n\n\n\nThe Numbers That Tell the Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetitionGoalsAssistsGamesG+A per 90\u2019Ligue\u00a01 24/25216291.40All Competitions 24/25351651\u2013\n\n\n\nSource: Footystats\n\n\n\nHis non-penalty xG jumped to 1.03 per 90, placing him in the 99th percentile among Ligue 1 attackers. His key passes per game also rose to 3.30, while his crossing accuracy improved to 35%, showing tangible growth in his decision-making and delivery (FBref Advanced Stats).\n\n\n\nOne of the season\u2019s defining moments came in the Champions League Final against Inter Milan, where Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 delivered two assists in a 5\u20130 victory\u2014sealing PSG\u2019s first-ever UCL title. He also scored a hat-trick earlier in the group stage against Stuttgart, solidifying his role as a reliable match-winner (UEFA).\n\n\n\nMentality Shift: From Flashes of Talent to Relentless Hunger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat stood out most wasn\u2019t just Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s stats; it was his shift in attitude. Once known for drifting out of games, he became relentless without the ball, pressing with purpose and running smartly into space. When a minor injury threatened to sideline him before the Champions League semifinal against Arsenal, the old Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 might\u2019ve sat it out. But this version pushed through the pain, stepped up, and made the difference. That change didn\u2019t happen overnight; it came from the trust and freedom Luis Enrique gave him. In return, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 became the kind of player who delivers when it truly counts.\n\n\n\nA Tactical System That Finally Fits\n\n\n\nThe tactical freedom Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 enjoyed at Paris Saint-Germain was crucial in unlocking his best version. Under Luis Enrique, PSG often played in a fluid 3-2-5 formation during possession, giving Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 the license to drift inside, link up with midfielders, and make devastating diagonal runs from deep. No longer stuck out wide like in his Barcelona days, where he was often forced into predictable one-on-one situations, he became a hybrid attacker, sometimes the creator, sometimes the finisher.\n\n\n\nFootball analyst coverage from El Pa\u00eds described him as the embodiment of Luis Enrique\u2019s \u201cfalse winger\u201d system players who drift centrally and attack vertically. His technical skills, vision, and positional fluidity made him perfect for it.\n\n\n\nFrom Flop to Ballon d\u2019Or Contender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the 2024\u201325 season, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 wasn\u2019t just in form; he was in the Ballon d\u2019Or conversation. With a domestic treble, 51 direct goal contributions across competitions, and multiple assists in the Champions League final, he became a genuine contender. French outlet L\u2019\u00c9quipe even described his UCL final display as \u201cimp\u00e9rial.\u201d Even when PSG narrowly lost the FIFA Club World Cup final, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 stood out among their best performers calm, mature, and crucial in transitions.\n\n\n\nFinal Whistle: The Redemption Arc We Didn\u2019t Expect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOusmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s story has flipped from a cautionary tale to one of football\u2019s most powerful redemption arcs. What began as an injury-laden spell at Barcelona has transformed into a career-defining chapter in Paris. It wasn\u2019t just tactics that changed him; it was mindset, belief, and consistent backing from Luis Enrique. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 stopped relying solely on flair and started mastering structure, responsibility, and timing. Now, with silverware in hand and the Ballon d\u2019Or within reach, he\u2019s no longer the player of \u201cwhat could\u2019ve been\u201d; he\u2019s the one proving everyone wrong, one big night at a time.\n\n\n\nOusmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 PSG, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 Champions League 2025, Luis Enrique tactics PSG, PSG treble season, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 transformation, PSG UCL win, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 Ballon d\u2019Or contender\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about\u00a0\u201cChelsea\u2019s Off-Field XI: Meet the Team Behind the Tweets.\u201d\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n",

      "content_full": "\nAt the hallowed grounds of Lord\u2019s, where history hangs in the air and echoes of legends whisper through the stands, the Indian women\u2019s cricket team walked out under grey skies, not just weather-wise but perhaps metaphorically too. They led the three-match ODI series 1-0 coming off a spirited win and had a chance to steal the deal. But cricket, that most unpredictable of games, had other plans\n\n\n\nEngland women, battered but not beaten in the first ODI, came out fighting in the second armed with skills, soaked strategy and little help from the England weather. As rain threatened to dampen not just the pitch but the spirit of the match, it instead added another layer of drama to a contest that kept fans across the globe glued to their screens.\n\n\n\nHarmanpreet Kaur, India\u201ds captain, watched as the coin flipped and landed not in her favor. England chose to bowl first with clouds rolling overhead and moisture in the air. It wasn\u2019t just a smart call; it was a decisive one.\n\n\n\nThe toss that turned\u00a0 the game\n\n\n\nHarmanpreet Kaur, India\u2019s captain, watched as the coin flipped and landed not in her favor. England chose to bowl first with clouds rolling overhead and moisture in the air. It wasn\u2019t just a smart call; it was a decisive one.\n\n\n\nIndia was put in to bat in what would become a 29-over-a-side rain-curtailed game; they needed urgency, and they needed assertiveness. Instead, they faltered. Cautious strokes, slow starts and wickets falling in clusters made sure that India never quite got going.\n\n\n\nSmriti Mandhana, graceful as always, tried to build something\u00a0 beautiful with her 42 off 51 balls. Deepti Sharma hung around with an unbeaten 30. But no partnership ever blossomed. Every time the innings seemed to find rhythm, England\u2019s bowlers struck like clockwork.\n\n\n\nSophie Ecclestone: The Queen of control\n\n\n\nEngland\u201ds bowling attack, led by the brilliant Sophie Ecclestone, executed the plan with textbook precision. Ecclestone, who knows every inch of Lord\u2019s like the back of her hand, was unstoppable. Her six overs yielded three vital wickets for just 27 runs, reminding the world why she is one of the most feared spinners\u00a0 in the women\u2019s game. \n\n\n\nSupporting her was Em Arllot, whose pace and angles frustrated India\u201ds middle-order batters. With the figures of 2 of 26, she ensured there was no late surge from India. The Indian scoreboard stopped at 143 / 8 in 29 overs; the total looked neither here nor there.\n\n\n\nA Rainy Chase, Rewritten by DLS\n\n\n\nAs the chase began, the rain loomed ominously in the background. But England openers played like the sun was shining. Tammy Beaumont (34) and Amy Jones (46*) stitched together a fluent 54-run partnership.\u00a0Their intent was clear: they didn\u2019t want to leave anything to the weather gods. Then the inevitable rain stopped play again. With England cruising at 102/1 in 18.4 overs, the DLS method came into play and revised the target. 115 in 24 overs. A mere 13 more runs to win from 32 balls\n\n\n\nThe English side returned, picked up where they left off and calmly won an 8-wicket win, leveling the series 1-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u201ds missed opportunities:\n\n\n\nFor India. It wasn\u2019t just about what they didn\u2019t do. It was about the moments they failed to seize. Harmanpreet Kaur later admitted. \u201cWe didn\u2019t bat well. Credit to England\u2019s Blowers. It just wasn\u2019t our day.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed it wasn\u2019t. The pacers struggled with line and length despite favorable swing conditions. Sneha Rana looked like the only spinner capable of turning things around and Kranthi Gaud did\u00a0 bowl\u00a0 a beauty to dismiss Natalie Scriver Brunt but by then\u00a0 the game had already slipped away.\n\n\n\nThe Final showdown in Durham\n\n\n\nNow the series stands evenly poised. With one match\u00a0 to go, the\u00a0 third ODI at Chester-le-Street on July 22 promises high drama. It\u2019s not just a game anymore. It\u2019s a battle of mental strength, tactical clarity and who wants it more.\n\n\n\nWill India bounce back with the resilience they showed in the first ODI? Or will England ride the wave of this dominant win and take home the trophy? The stage is set. The spotlight is waiting. And the world will be watching\n",

      "content_full": "\nIn Test cricket, where patience is currency and strategy spans days, the spotlight usually falls on centurions, five-wicket hauls, and match-turning partnerships. But just outside that frame\u2014often unnoticed\u2014are the substitute fielders, the silent game-changers.\n\n\n\nThey don\u2019t make it to the toss. Their names rarely appear on scorecards. Yet, in the right moment, a substitute fielder can decide a match with one throw, one sprint, or one diving catch. From epic Ashes Tests to gritty subcontinental battles, the 12th and 13th men have quietly shaped outcomes with their alertness, agility, and sheer commitment to being ready\u2014even when they might not play a single ball.\n\n\n\nGame-Changers from the Sidelines\n\n\n\nOne of the most famous examples came during the 2005 Ashes. Gary Pratt \u2014 a name etched into England folklore \u2014 wasn\u2019t even a squad member. A county cricketer subbing in for an injured Simon Jones, he famously ran out Ricky Ponting with a direct hit at Trent Bridge. That moment turned the tide of the match and series and even led to Ponting\u2019s now-iconic on-field outburst about England\u2019s liberal use of subs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen similar impact. In 2019, Mayank Agarwal, who wasn\u2019t in the playing XI, took a crucial catch as a substitute fielder during India\u2019s tour of Australia. In 2021, India\u2019s T. Natarajan\u2014in his first ever overseas tour\u2014came in as a net bowler, ended up making his debut later, but also fielded as 12th man and took two vital boundary catches before even playing a match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese aren\u2019t anomalies. They reflect the growing athleticism, readiness, and mindset that modern teams demand even from their non-playing members.\n\n\n\nThe Mental Grind of the 12th Man\n\n\n\nBeing a substitute in Test cricket is a strange emotional space. You train just as hard, suit up every morning, and follow every tactic, yet there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll step onto the field. And when you do, it\u2019s not for glory but often for the pressure-cooker moments: a tired bowler limps off, and you\u2019re suddenly fielding at short leg or deep mid-wicket with one job\u2014don\u2019t mess it up.\n\n\n\nMentally, it\u2019s exhausting. \u201cYou have to be in the match without being in the match,\u201d said Abhimanyu Easwaran, a frequent reserve for India in overseas tests. \u201cYou\u2019re visualizing yourself out there, staying sharp, but the adrenaline of actually playing isn\u2019t there. You need to create your own intensity.\u201d\n\n\n\nSubstitute fielders spend hours doing catching drills, warming up bowlers, and studying match plans\u2014all without the thrill of potentially taking wickets or scoring runs. Yet many of them see this as a badge of honor: a stepping stone to the main squad or simply their way of contributing to a team they deeply care about.\n\n\n\nPreparation Without Promise\n\n\n\nUnlike white-ball cricket, where substitutes are rare and tactical changes limited, Test cricket offers more breathing room \u2014 and more physical toll. Hamstrings tighten, players dive hard, and sunburn kicks in. That\u2019s when the substitute gets his chance.\n\n\n\nModern support staff don\u2019t treat the 12th or 13th man as just an accessory. They receive tailored fitness regimens, are included in strategic huddles, and are assigned contingency roles\u2014like being the emergency fielder for key positions (slip, close-in, boundary patrol). In elite teams, substitutes are expected to be fielding specialists, often more athletic than some of the seniors.\n\n\n\nSome players, like Australia\u2019s Michael Bevan and India\u2019s Wriddhiman Saha, were known to be exceptional 12th men\u2014always energetic, reliable under the high ball, and quick on the throw. In a game where one dropped catch can swing the pendulum, that reliability is golden.\n\n\n\nMotivation Without Spotlight\n\n\n\nSo what drives a player to dive full-length in the 89th over of Day 4 when they know they aren\u2019t even playing?\n\n\n\nThe answer is pride. Pride in the jersey, pride in being trusted, and pride in knowing that even a cameo on the field could make history. Substitute fielders often say they feel more pressure \u2014 not less \u2014 because they want to live up to the trust their teammates place in them. There\u2019s also a strong team culture in squads like India, Australia, and New Zealand that emphasizes contribution over recognition.\n\n\n\nFor many players, those substitute outings are their audition. Field well today, and the selectors might remember your name when injuries strike or new squads are picked. It\u2019s also why you often see fringe players throwing themselves around with the hunger of someone who knows: one catch could be my breakthrough.\n\n\n\nConclusion: A Role That Deserves Recognition\n\n\n\nSubstitute fielders don\u2019t get their names in lights, but they often light up the game in invisible ways \u2014 from energizing tired teammates to snatching a breakthrough catch that no one else saw coming.\n\n\n\nAs Test cricket evolves, teams are beginning to value the 12th and 13th men not as backups, but as assets. In a format where margins are razor-thin, these forgotten figures on the boundary line may just be the unsung heroes who tip the balance.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe Calcutta Football League (CFL) was the first football tournament in India, and it was held in 1898. It is the oldest existing football league in the region of Asia as well as one of the oldest anywhere in the world, organized by the Indian Football Association (IFA) of West Bengal. It has been an element of pride of Kolkata all along, which is also part of its culture.\n\n\n\nFootball was already all over the place in Kolkata many years before the birth of the CFL. Clubs like Calcutta FC, formed in 1872, and Trades Club, formed in 1876, started playing friendly matches. The first city competition was in 1889, the Trades Cup. Initially there were purely British and European participants, a reflection of the colonial strength of the era.\n\n\n\nGradually Indian teams began to enter. In 1914, Mohun Bagan and Aryans had joined the second division. The biggest moment was in the year 1934, when the Mohammedan Sporting team became the first Indian team to win the top division in the CFL, which they did consecutively in 1934, 1935, 1936, and 1937.\n\n\n\nDominance of the Big Three Clubs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Three football clubs in Kolkata, namely the East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and the Mohammedan Sporting club have always been under the limelight in the long history of Calcutta Football League. East Bengal leads with 39 titles and Mohun Bagan is in second position with an aggregate of 30 titles and Mohammedan Sporting is in the third position with 14 titles. Collectively, they not only created the story of the league but have also contributed to the growth of the popularity of football in the country of India.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Big Three are usually on the front line other clubs have made their mark. In 1958, the championship of Eastern railway was a big thing as it broke the monopoly of major clubs. Recently, the title was won in the 2019-20 season by Peerless SC, the first non-Big Three club to do so in 61 years. The legacy of CFL demonstrates the great love of the people of Kolkata to the football and how the game is part of the social and cultural heritage of the city.\n\n\n\nDownfall of this Historical League\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite its rich cultural heritage and the passionate football culture of Kolkata, the CFL today grapples with numerous challenges that threaten its prominence in Indian football.\n\n\n\n1. Financial Struggles of Smaller Clubs: Many historic clubs, such as Aryan FC and Kalighat Milan Sangha, face severe financial constraints. These clubs, once nurseries for national talent, now struggle with limited sponsorships and rising operational costs. Officials often resort to personal savings to cover expenses, leading to a decline in infrastructure and player development.\n\n\n\n2. Administrative and Scheduling Issues: The CFL has been plagued by administrative inefficiencies. For instance, the 2024 season extended well beyond its scheduled conclusion due to disputes over player eligibility and match-fixing allegations. Such delays disrupt the league\u2019s rhythm and erode its credibility .\n\n\n\n3. Infrastructure and Player Welfare Concerns: Many clubs lack dedicated training grounds and rely on shared or substandard facilities. During monsoons, poor ground conditions often lead to match cancellations. Additionally, players from economically disadvantaged backgrounds face inadequate nutrition and medical support, affecting their performance and career longevity .\n\n\n\n4. Political Interference and Governance Issues: Political affiliations within club administrations have led to controversies, including involvement in financial scandals. Such entanglements divert attention from the sport and hinder transparent governance.\n\n\n\n5. Declining Local Talent Representation: The introduction of the \u201cson of the soil\u201d rule aimed to ensure local player participation. However, debates persist regarding its implementation, with some advocating for stricter quotas to promote regional talent. Concerns about address fraud and inadequate verification processes further complicate the issue.\n\n\n\n6. Overshadowing by National Leagues: The rise of national leagues like the Indian Super League (ISL) has shifted focus away from state leagues. Top clubs prioritize national competitions, often fielding second-string teams in the CFL, leading to diminished fan interest and media coverage.\n\n\n\nMore from sportspedia Zone: \n\n\n\n\nIs the Governance Battle Between AIFF and FSDL Putting Indian Football at Risk?\n\n\n\nThe Mental Burnout of Test Debutants in the Bazball Era\n\n\n\nBruised but not broken: Can England Women Rise from the Ashes Against India in the 2nd ODI?\n\n\n\nINDIA vs ENGLAND 4th Test Preview: Do-or-Die Battle for India at Old Trafford, High-Stakes Showdown\n\n\n\n\nPossible Scopes of Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough there are some procedures to improve Calcutta Football League (CFL),\n\n\n\n1. Strengthening Grassroots Development: A robust grassroots framework is vital for nurturing future talent. Initiatives like East Bengal\u2019s School of Excellence aim to identify and train young players across West Bengal and the Northeast, providing expert coaching and sports science support at minimal costs. Expanding such programs statewide and integrating them with school and community football can create a sustainable talent\n\n\n\n2. Enhancing League Structure and Competitiveness: The CFL\u2019s seven-tier pyramid, encompassing over 160 teams, offers a comprehensive competitive landscape. Recent reforms, such as the \u2018Son of Soil\u2019 rule mandating at least four West Bengal-born players in the starting XI, promote local talent. Further, the introduction of the Bengal Super League (BSL) as a franchise-based competition aims to professionalize district-level football and serve as a feeder system for higher leagues.\n\n\n\n3. Investing in Infrastructure and Facilities: Upgrading training grounds, stadiums, and medical facilities is crucial for player development and fan engagement. The CFL utilizes multiple venues across the state, including the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata and Kalyani Stadium, to host matches. Ensuring these facilities meet international standards can enhance the matchday experience and attract larger audiences.\n\n\n\n4. Expanding Media Coverage and Fan Engagement: Media exposure is essential for increasing the league\u2019s visibility. Zee 24 Ghanta\u2019s commitment to broadcasting CFL matches on television and digital platforms has improved accessibility for fans. Leveraging social media, live streaming, and interactive content can further engage younger audiences and build a broader fan base.\n\n\n\n5. Promoting Inclusivity and Diversity: The appointment of Sujata Kar as the first female head coach of a senior men\u2019s team in CFL history marks a significant step toward gender inclusivity in Indian football. Encouraging diversity in coaching, administration, and player recruitment can enrich the league\u2019s cultural fabric and appeal.\n\n\n\n6. Fostering Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with European clubs, such as those by Borussia Dortmund and Rangers, offer opportunities for knowledge exchange and talent development. Establishing similar partnerships can provide CFL clubs with access to advanced training methodologies and international exposure.\n\n\n\n7. Celebrating Heritage and Cultivating Rivalries: The CFL\u2019s rich history, including iconic rivalries among East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, and Mohammedan Sporting, is a unique asset. Organizing heritage matches, commemorative events, and storytelling initiatives can rekindle nostalgia and strengthen community ties.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nProtecting Calcutta Football League is a way of curing an entire situation all at once, putting the illustrious history on a starting block to the present aspirations. Few bullets: beef up grassroots initiatives, straighten out the league system, dump money into stadiums/training facilities, communicate with the media, open up the game to all, find good partners to go with, and embrace the history of the League. \n\n\n\nWhen we address all these areas, then CFL can become the leader again and inspire upcoming players and fans, as it did in the past.\n",

The Indian Super League (ISL), the country\u2019s flagship football competition, is on hold and the reason isn\u2019t a pandemic or an organiser error it\u2019s a governance deadlock between the AIFF and FSDL. And the fallout is spreading: players unsure of contracts, clubs scrambling, youth programmes stalling, fans anxious.\n\n\n\nStory Behind It\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 11, 2025, FSDL Reliance-backed owner and operator of ISL officially wrote to AIFF and ISL clubs to say the 2025\u201326 season could not proceed without clarity on its commercial rights under the Master Rights Agreement (MRA), which expires on December 8, 2025 and has been the bedrock of ISL operations since 2010. FSDL said flatly: \u201cWe are unable to effectively plan, organise or commercialise the season.\u201d\u202f Source: TelegraphIndia\n\n\n\nJust a day later, on July 12, AIFF released a statement acknowledging the impasse: negotiations for the MRA began in late 2024, continued in early 2025, but were formally halted after a Supreme Court directive in April forbade any renewed agreement until it ruled on AIFF\u2019s governance constitution. That legal limbo has frozen everything.\u202f Source: Livemint\n\n\n\nSunil Chhetri\u2019s Emotional Plea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunil Chhetri India\u2019s most revered footballer has stepped up, not with tactical analysis, but with a plea. He wrote on social media:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEverybody in the Indian football ecosystem is worried, hurt, scared\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe urged everyone to stay calm and united as the crisis unfolds.\u202f \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWhen my phone went off a few weeks ago informing us of a delay in pre-season by a fortnight, I must admit it made me smile. And that\u2019s because I was on vacation, hadn\u2019t moved as much as I would have liked to, and hadn\u2019t been eating as clean as I usually do. I had more time than I\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pEGyr8Sp5O\u2014 Sunil Chhetri (@chetrisunil11) July 16, 2025\n\n\n\n\nIn interviews, Chhetri detailed how a sabbatical announcement that initially felt like a welcome \u201cfortnight delay\u201d spiraled into an indefinite freeze and how players across clubs are reaching out, distraught and uncertain.\u202f Source: Indiatoday\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s Behind What?\n\n\n\nFSDL, since 2014, has paid \u20b950 crore annually to AIFF under the MRA in exchange for broadcasting, sponsorship, and promotional rights. This agreement ends in December 2025. FSDL now proposes a new governance model: a holding company split with 60% clubs, 26% FSDL, and only 14% AIFF, sharing profits instead of fixed fees. \n\n\n\nAIFF, reliant on FSDL\u2019s \u20b950 crore to fund operations and development, resists the model\u201414% offers far less and delays the reliable income it depends upon. Negotiations stalled, and the Supreme Court\u2019s order froze any new deal until AIFF\u2019s constitution case is decided.\n\n\n\nClubs And Players Are In Doubt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nISL clubs across the country paused pre-season training and withdrew from tournaments like the 2025 Durand Cup. Teams like Bengaluru FC, Kerala Blasters, Chennaiyin FC, Odisha FC, Mumbai City FC, Hyderabad FC all have halted operations.\n\n\n\nChennaiyin FC have already sacked coach Owen Coyle, citing financial strain from planning uncertainty. Recruitments, staff hires, sponsorships, and broadcasting deals are all on hold.\n\n\n\nIndian Football Fans Are Paying the Price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers and support staff are directly impacted. Without matches, training routines collapse, contract renewals vanish, and some income sources dry up. Chhetri pointed out that he, his teammates, physiotherapists, kit managers, and operations staff\u2014many live month-to-month on match fees and club stipends\u2014are anxious.\n\n\n\nYouth setups run by ISL clubs key development pathways\u2014are now idle. The broader plan of building a pyramid and including institutional leagues is overshadowed.\n\n\n\nGovernance vs. Growth\n\n\n\nAIFF PositionFSDL PositionEnsure stable funding via \u20b950 crore annual fees into youth developmentPush for shared-ownership model and long-term profit structureSeeks accountability and clarity, including promotion/relegation systemPrioritizes control over commercial operations in a franchise model\n\n\n\nSource: Economictimes\n\n\n\nA Broader Threat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just clubs and contracts, it\u2019s the soul of Indian football. ISL was meant to professionalize sport in India; delay threatens progress. The gap between I-League and ISL, youth scouting, and grassroots growth all stall without a stable top-tier league.\u202f\n\n\n\nReddit discussions underscore frustration that AIFF officials delayed talks until late, meaning AIFF lacks leverage; FSDL suffered losses (\u20b95,000 crore+ since 2014), and now the federation fears losing easy revenue.\u202f\n\n\n\nHow This Might Be Resolved\n\n\n\n\nShort-term MRA extension under current conditions until the Supreme Court rules.\n\n\n\nA balanced hybrid structure that blends FSDL\u2019s commercial strength with AIFF\u2019s developmental mandate, if new revenue share is structured fairly.\n\n\n\nSetting up an impact task force: club CEOs, player reps, AIFF, FSDL, and legal experts to iron out promotion/relegation, youth structure, revenue sharing, and governance.\n\n\n\nSupreme Court verdict on AIFF\u2019s new constitution which could unlock MRA talks. Experts expect possible clearance by late July\u2013August, paving way for an ISL start by October.\n\n\n\n\nIn Chhetri\u2019s Words: Why We Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChhetri\u2019s plea wasn\u2019t strategic, it was emotional, almost paternal. It was for every player, every unseen kitman, every physio living pay-check to pay-check.\u202fReactions and unity from players could pressure both sides into compromise.\u202f\n\n\n\nHe ended with hope:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cKeep training\u2026 it will resume.\u201d That hopeful echo is the tether keeping India\u2019s football dream alive.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Indiatoday\n\n\n\nISL governance dispute, AIFF FSDL negotiation, ISL season on hold, impact on Indian football players, Sunil Chhetri reaction.\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about\u00a0\u201cThe Mental Burnout of Test Debutants in the Bazball Era\u201d\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe longest form of the game has always been the ultimate challenge of skill, temperament, and stamina. However, the situation has changed radically over the last couple of years. The introduction of what has been termed Bazball, a description of the hyper-aggressive, high-scoring England team led by coach Brendon McCullum, has all but changed the barometer that players have to expect, both in relation to batters and bowlers and also first-time Test players.\n\n\n\nAlthough Bazball has regenerated the sport, exciting the spectators, it has also subjected the debutants to tremendous psychological pressure to prove themselves the moment they enter the field. This new cricketing culture does not call merely on technical ability but on psychological strength in the ruthless glare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBazball: Fast-Paced Cricket\u2019s Double-Edged Sword\n\n\n\nThe Bazball philosophy is centered on rapid scoring, adventurous batting, and fierce bowling. It is an adventurous move that is not shy of normal Test cricket with its slow tempo and conservative approaches. Although this has created the much-needed vigor, there becomes an added pressure on the new ones.\n\n\n\nThe novices do not get time to settle and get into their groove as earlier because everyone is expected to shift gears and get used to the fast pace of the game. Coaches and selectors want an immediate response, an innings that wins the match, or a spell of breaks that shows the value of having one in the team.\n\n\n\nThe Psychological Toll on Debutantes\n\n\n\nThis pressure usually leads to mental burnout of the players, most especially those in the youth. The test cricket form of the game is already a challenging task to play; forget about the switching of playing the game to come and play after all that you have been playing domestic or limited-over cricket. Add Bazball\u2019s sense of urgency to the ingredients of the mix, and the mind pressure is multi-fold.\n\n\n\nNew players in the test field like Mukesh Kumar would not find it easy to deliver penetrative spells on their turns. Similarly, other players like Shoaib Bashir also find themselves in the spotlights, but instead they have to force shots to collect runs, and they have to do it as fast as they can along with nerves and inexperience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples: Mukesh Kumar and Shoaib Bashir\n\n\n\nMukesh Kumar\u2019s early Test appearances reflect this pressure. Known for his swing bowling in domestic circuits, he quickly found himself bowling in crucial overs with limited margin for error. The demands of Bazball mean mistakes are scrutinized intensely, and the mental load of performing can lead to physical fatigue and loss of confidence.\n\n\n\nShoaib Bashir, a young batter making his Test debut in a high-tempo England lineup, experienced the challenges of adapting to an aggressive game plan that leaves little room for traditional patient batting. The expectation to \u201cgo big or go home\u201d places heavy mental burdens on newcomers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoping Mechanisms and Support Systems\n\n\n\nRecognizing these pressures, teams are investing more in psychological support. Sports psychologists are increasingly part of the coaching staff, helping players develop coping strategies for stress and burnout. Techniques such as mindfulness, visualization, and mental conditioning are becoming standard practice.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, experienced players mentor newcomers, offering guidance on handling the intense scrutiny that accompanies modern Test cricket.\n\n\n\nThe Need for Balanced Expectations\n\n\n\nWhile Bazball has revitalized Test cricket, there is a growing consensus that balancing aggression with patience is essential, especially for debutants. Allowing players a buffer to acclimatize rather than demanding immediate impact could reduce burnout and enhance long-term performance.\n\n\n\nSelectors and coaches are challenged to foster environments that value process over instant results, nurturing talent sustainably.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe Bazball era is changing Test cricket\u2019s mental landscape, demanding that debutants perform at breakneck speed under relentless pressure. While this creates thrilling cricket for fans, it also brings a mental toll that must be managed carefully.\n\n\n\nSupporting young players like Mukesh Kumar and Shoaib Bashir through this transition is crucial not just for their careers but for the future health of Test cricket itself.\n",

      "content_full": "\nWhen India Women step out to play the second ODI against England Women on July 19, 2025, at Lords, one thought is at the back of the cricketing mind: can the England Women come back after this? The Indian team not only took the first blood in the series but also left a very strong message towards the ICC Women\u2019s ODI World Cup later this year after a four-wicket clinch defeat hosted by Southampton.\n\n\n\nThis is not another bilateral series; this is a World Cup audition, a redemption story, and a Ford test at depth. The ex-champions, England, now look in the face of the loss of the home series, which is something that happens quite infrequently and which would sting even more in the current context of English white-ball games.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019 s High on Momentum and Depth\n\n\n\nIndia\u201ds current squad is arguably the most balanced and dangerous they have fielded in years. Led by the calm and confident Harmanpreet Kaur, the visitors are building something special. Their recent tri-series win involving Sri Lanka and South Africa and now the victory in the first ODI point to a unit that is hitting its peak at just the right time.\n\n\n\nYoung stars like Kranti Gaud and Amanjout Kaur have stepped up in the absence of seasoned pacers like Renuka Singh and Pooja Vastrakar; Kranti\u2019s two wickets with the new ball showed maturity beyond her years. The faith shown in her by the team management is paying off handsomely.\n\n\n\nAt the top, Pratika Rawal is emerging as a serious contender for a permanent opening spot. With Shafali Verma and Harleen Deol pushing hard, India\u201ds top order has rich options. Deepthi Sharma, fresh off a Rishabh Pant-like one-handed six-winning match-winning knock in the opener, continues to be India\u201ds MVP.\n\n\n\nThe spin department is overflowing with talent: Sree Charani, Sneha Rana, Deepti, and Radha Yadav form a lethal arsenal that can choke even the best lineups on any surface.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s Crisis of Confidence:\n\n\n\nEngland, on the other hand, is in a spot of bother. The team led by Nat Sciver-Burnt lacks the ruthlessness of past generations. The defeat at Southampton marked their fifth consecutive ODI loss at home to India, a start that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.\n\n\n\nBatting collapses, inconsistent bowling, and an overreliance on a few stars have made England vulnerable. Players like Sophie Ecclestone, Alice Capsey, and Tammy Beaumont have the pedigree but need to deliver now. Ecclestone\u201ds lack of impact in the first ODI was surprising given her status as the world\u2019s top-ranked spinner.\n\n\n\nThe absence of clarity in team roles is also hurting them. Are they rebuilding or competing? The answer isn\u2019t clear. They will need their middle order to stand up and bowlers to be disciplined, especially in the death overs, if they are to keep the series alive.\n\n\n\nLord\u2019s: A venue of history, pressure, and redemption.\n\n\n\nThe Mecca of cricket is not just another ground; it adds a layer of emotion, expectation, and legacy. For India, playing here is a celebration of progress. For England it could either be the start of a comeback or the site of another heartbreak.\n\n\n\nThe Pitch at Lord\u2019s typically offers between bat and ball. With overcast conditions expected, seamers might find early movement making toss crucial. England\u2019s fast bowlers like Lauren Bell and Kate Cross will be under pressure to deliver.\n\n\n\nA Defining Day for Both Teams:\n\n\n\nSaturday\u2019s second ODI isn\u2019t just another game for India. It\u2019s a chance to seal the series and assert dominance away from home. For England it\u2019s a battle for pride, belief, and momentum. Lose this, and the pressure only mounts with the World Cup approaching. The stage is set. The stakes are high. And the Cickert promises to be fiery. Can England bounce back? Or will India stamp their authority once again?\n",

Yet they delivered a performance every fan will remember: a 3\u20110 demolition of Champions League winners Paris Saint\u2011Germain. It wasn\u2019t just a result; it was a statement of collective grit, pressing intelligence, and individual brilliance.\n\n\n\nThey pressed high. They marked man-to-man. They ran like their lives depended on it. Every ball, every second, every tackle they made PSG work, suffer, and eventually crumble.\n\n\n\nHow Palmer Ignited Chelsea\u2019s Win\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCole Palmer at just 23 took the world stage by storm:\n\n\n\n\n22\u2032: A turnover by PSG\u2019s Nuno Mendes gifted the ball to Malo Gusto. After his blocked shot, Palmer was left unmarked and stroked a calm left\u2011foot finish inside the post\u00a0 .\n\n\n\n30\u2032: Levi Colwill\u2019s perfectly weighted through-ball split PSG. Palmer cut inside, sold Vitinha a dummy, and curled another beauty past Donnarumma into the left corner\u00a0 .\n\n\n\n43\u2032: Breaking from wide, Palmer delivered a pinpoint pass to Jo\u00e3o Pedro, who lifted a delightful chip over the keeper to make it 3\u20110 before half-time. Source: ESPN\n\n\n\n\nHe was rightly named Man of the Match and the tournament\u2019s Golden Ball winner.\n\n\n\nMaresca\u2019s Game Plan: Man\u2011to\u2011Man Marking + Pressing Overload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnzo Maresca set up his young side to mirror what makes PSG so dangerous but to outwork them.\n\n\n\nHis players pressed in man-to-man roles right from kickoff. Pedro Neto tracked Hakimi, Colwill followed Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, and Cucurella shadowed Dou\u00e9. The result: PSG had no time or space to operate in midfield\u00a0 .\n\n\n\nCombined with a high press, this approach strangled PSG\u2019s usual dynamic passing game in the first 10 minutes, exactly when Chelsea scored twice. When PSG tried to recover, Chelsea switched to a compact defensive block (4\u20114\u20112 shape), cutting passing lanes while still maintaining structure for counters.\n\n\n\nPSG Neutralized by Man\u2011Marking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFluid Rotations Crushed PSG\u2019s usual rotations from Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 drifting wide to midfielders interchanging were nullified by one-to-one tracking. Their buildup was compressed and predictable.\n\n\n\nWeakness Exposed on the Left Nuno Mendes usually PSG\u2019s engine down the left, gave the ball away cheaply, leaving Palmer and Gusto free to drive Chelsea\u2019s early breakthrough.\n\n\n\nProlific Pressing Payoff The Blues absorbed PSG\u2019s counterattacks and launched long-ball breaks with devastating effect especially via their right side.\n\n\n\nS\u00e1nchez and the Clean Sheet Goalkeeper Robert S\u00e1nchez kept Chelsea afloat with clutch saves, particularly to deny Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Vitinha when PSG pushed after halftime.\n\n\n\nGame Over with Red Card Fuel PSG midfielder Jo\u00e3o Neves was sent off late (85\u2032) for pulling Cucurella\u2019s hair.

Chelsea didn\u2019t sit back or play reactive football. Instead, they showed that with the right tactical setup, fierce work rate, and mental clarity, even a team like PSG with all its stars and firepower can be neutralized. Every player knew their role. Every run, every press, every challenge had intent behind it. It wasn\u2019t chaos it was calculated, controlled aggression.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of it all stood Cole Palmer not just the man of the match but arguably the player of the tournament. On the biggest stage of his young career, Palmer played with a calmness and clarity well beyond his years. He didn\u2019t just score twice and assist another; he dictated the rhythm, picked his moments, and made elite defenders look average. This performance didn\u2019t just elevate his status; it may have marked the arrival of a new star in world football.\n\n\n\nMore importantly, this victory served as a defining moment for Enzo Maresca\u2019s Chelsea project. What many initially dismissed as a team in transition now looks like a cohesive, tactically sharp, and fearlessly youth-driven unit. \n\n\n\nThe win wasn\u2019t just about the result, it was about identity. Under Maresca, Chelsea aren\u2019t just rebuilding, they\u2019re evolving. And by securing their second Club World Cup title, they\u2019ve added another jewel to their growing international crown while announcing to the football world: this is a side that\u2019s here to stay and they\u2019re only getting started.\n\n\n\nFuture Is Bright\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn New Jersey\u2019s heat, Chelsea\u2019s young team executed Maresca\u2019s blueprint to perfection. High-energy press, mapped man-marking, and clinical transitions unsettled PSG from the first whistle. When Cole Palmer produced two goals and a decisive assist, the title was theirs.\n\n\n\nThe victory wasn\u2019t just about tactics\u2014it was about belief. The belief that a team made up of rising talents, strategic minds, and collective hunger could stand toe-to-toe with Europe\u2019s elite and deliver a performance worthy of a global title. This was not just a win. It was a masterclass. A blueprint. A night that will be etched into Chelsea folklore for years to come.\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about\u00a0\u201cA European Breakthrough: Italy Creates History by Qualifying for ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2026\u201d\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n",

India has played 2 test matches and has already lost 2 matches, and India has to win to be in the game to be in the 2nd position in the ICC World Test Championship 2025-27. It is a megamatch where a lot is at stake. Can India win at Old Trafford, or will Ben Stokes\u2019 England team close out the series strong?\n\n\n\nIndia vs England 4th Test; Venue Overview: Manchester Jinx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia had never won a Test at Old Trafford previously. It is common that the fast bowlers are assisted with the pitch at the initial stages, but it becomes easier to bat since then. If it\u2019s cloudy, that could change the game, so how well teams bowl with the new ball will be the key. Let\u2019s look at the test record of India at Old Trafford:\n\n\n\n\nMatches played: 9\n\n\n\nIndia Won: 0\n\n\n\nIndia Lost: 4\n\n\n\nDraw: 5\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s highest score: 432/10 in 119.2 overs in 1990\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s lowest score: 58/10 in 21.4 overs in 1952\n\n\n\n\nThis Indian team, with Shubman Gill and a younger, bolder team, could very well cope with English conditions much better than the previous Indian teams. So, there\u2019s a chance for this new Indian team to break the records of years in the India vs England 4th Test. Indian batsmen will be able to surpass the highest score of the stadium taken by Mohammad Azharuddin (179 runs off 243 balls), and Indian bowlers are getting an opportunity to take a fifer like Lala Amarnath, Vinoo Mankad, Surendranath, and Dilip Doshi.\n\n\n\nKey players to keep an eye on: India vs England 4th Test\n\n\n\nWith the India vs England 4th Test on the cards, everyone is dwelling on a few players who might actually give them a run in this major game:\n\n\n\nINDIAN Team:\n\n\n\n1. Shubman Gill: The captain of Team India has already shown his potential, and he has already broken a few records in this series. His score in Lord\u2019s was not that good, but it is expected that he will Captain Gill will create a captivating innings in Old Trafford.\n\n\n\n2. Risabh Pant: The violent manner with which Pant bats, along with the improved wicket-keeping abilities, may prove critical on English soil, where the ball does swing extensively.\n\n\n\n3. Jasprit Bumrah: Bumrah is the one who can trigger the ball and make a spell or two; he is the secret weapon of India in Manchester.\n\n\n\n4. KL Rahul: Rahul has a composed personality and some methods that can stabilize India batting order.\n\n\n\n5. Ravindra Jadeja: The all-rounder\u2019s dual role as a wicket-taker and counter-attacking batter adds immense value, especially on a Day 4\u20135 pitch, as at Lord\u2019s, he was there fighting on the pitch till the end.\n\n\n\n6. Akash Deep: This Bengal fast bowler is turning into a reliable third option in England, given his good track record and how he\u2019s been bowling lately.\n\n\n\nRavindra Jadeja in the Last Test\n\n\n\nENGLAND Team:\n\n\n\n1. Joe Root: Root is the most important in the English batting. He is also very adept at taking pressure and turning promising innings into mammoth ones, and that will be really handy.\n\n\n\n2. Ben Stokes: Stokes has a lot of energy, commands intelligently, and is capable of turning the game with his batting and bowling.\n\n\n\n3. Jofra Archer: The speed/bounce in this case caused by Archer could be vital with the Old Trafford a quick wicket.\n\n\n\n4. Chris Woakes: Woakes is great in English conditions. His swing bowling and runs down the order mean he\u2019s the complete package at home.\n\n\n\n5. Brydon Carse: The tall, fast bowler brings something different with his bounce and how he moves the ball. In the last test at Lord\u2019s, he even scored 56 runs in 83 balls in the first innings.\n\n\n\n6. Jamie Smith: He is a wicket-keeper batter with a cool temperament who can move his smooth shots very much. If he plays well here, he could lock down his spot.\n\n\n\nJoe Root at the 3rd Test at Lord\u2019s\n\n\n\nWhy is Old Trafford like a nightmare for India?\n\n\n\nOld Trafford has never lacked the fame of having one of the best pitches, especially favoring seam bowlers. Old Trafford is on the swing side, and the pitch does not dry out. This makes it great for fast bowlers, especially guys like James Anderson and Stuart Broad, who have ruled here for years.\n\n\n\nKey reasons for India\u2019s tough time in this pitch:\n\n\n\n\nThe weather factor plays a pivotal role; Manchester\u2019s weather can be all over the place, and it often helps England\u2019s swing bowlers at the start of a game. Let\u2019s see what will happen in the India vs England 4th Test.\n\n\n\nEarly swing and bounce often make problems for Indian batters. \n\n\n\nIn the case of the Indian team, the more they lose, the more difficult it is to break the losing streak in the end.\n\n\n\n\nIndia vs England 4th Test: Is it possible for India to break the 89-year curse?\n\n\n\nThe India vs England 4th Test is super important; the stakes are high as the teams are getting ready for the match at Old Trafford. If India wins, they can make history, prove the haters wrong, and finally win in Manchester. Shubman Gill and the young guys are showing some real talent, and India\u2019s fast bowlers are hitting their stride, so now\u2019s the time for them to step up. They broke the record in Edgbaston; now it\u2019s their time to break the curse of 89 years in Manchester.\n\n\n\nAs England is already leading (2-1), they have a chance to wrap up the series and keep crushing it in the World Test Championship, and England has always played well in Old Trafford, their home ground. It\u2019s the Indian team\u2019s time to pull up their socks and give their best to draw the series for now and put a full stop to years of curse.\n\n\n\nNo matter what happens, this test series promises to be exciting and memorable. Get ready for a big moment in India vs. England Test history.\n\n\n\n\n",

However, in the case of Mitchell Starc and Alyssa Healy, this most significant of partnerships started off the field, way back when they were still very much unheard of as household names of the Australian men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams.\n\n\n\nThey are a classic friends-to-lovers story, reminding us that it is sometimes true that the best-laid teams are ones that are formed over years of silent knowledge and mutual desires.\n\n\n\nEarly Days: Cricket Runs in the Family\n\n\n\nAlyssa Healy was born into cricket. She\u2019s the niece of Australian wicketkeeping legend Ian Healy, so the game was in her blood from the start. Mitchell Starc, on the other hand, was a lanky left-arm quick making waves in Sydney\u2019s junior cricket circuits.\n\n\n\nThey first crossed paths as kids playing junior representative cricket in New South Wales. Both were wicketkeepers at the time \u2014 yes, even Starc started behind the stumps before switching to fast bowling. This unlikely coincidence made them fast friends.\n\n\n\nThey were just teenagers then, growing up side by side in training camps, school cricket, and regional teams. What began as friendly banter over catches and stumpings turned into a bond built on trust, respect, and the shared grind of chasing elite-level dreams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing Together, Separately\n\n\n\nAs they got older, cricket took them down slightly different paths. Alyssa made her mark in women\u2019s domestic cricket and rose to be Australia\u2019s first-choice wicketkeeper and big-hitting opener. Starc traded the gloves for a blistering pace attack, becoming one of the world\u2019s most feared left-arm fast bowlers.\n\n\n\nDespite the demands of international tours, they stayed close. Friends say their bond stayed grounded because they\u2019d known each other long before fame, contracts, or World Cup finals.\n\n\n\nWhen Friendship Became Something More\n\n\n\nBy their early 20s, the childhood friendship slowly blossomed into something deeper. Both have shared in interviews that it just felt \u201cright\u201d\u2014a natural evolution from countless hours of conversations, backyard hits, and road trips to games.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, the pair made it official, and cricket fans around Australia loved them even more for their easygoing vibe and lack of drama. They were often spotted cheering each other on at games, with Starc seen in the stands at women\u2019s internationals, and Healy proudly watching Starc\u2019s fiery spells for the Aussie men\u2019s team.\n\n\n\nThe Wedding \u2014 and a True Power Couple\n\n\n\nIn 2016, they tied the knot in a private ceremony with family and friends \u2014 many of them cricketers, of course. It was a celebration of not just their relationship, but also the years they\u2019d spent pushing each other to be better players and better people.\n\n\n\nToday, Starc and Healy are Australian cricket\u2019s ultimate power couple. Healy has won multiple T20 World Cups and is one of the most explosive openers in the women\u2019s game. Starc, meanwhile, has played crucial roles in Australia\u2019s World Cup triumphs and Ashes series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sweetest Support System\n\n\n\nWhat makes their story so special is how they support each other, even when Cricket\u2019s schedules keep them apart. In 2020, Starc famously skipped an ODI to watch Alyssa play in the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final. It was a small but powerful moment, showing that behind the sixes and wicket hauls is a real marriage built on unconditional support.\n\n\n\nBoth have spoken about how they try to switch off from cricket when they\u2019re home \u2014 though with two elite cricketers under one roof, there\u2019s always a backyard net session or tactical chat just around the corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nMitchell Starc and Alyssa Healy\u2019s love story is more than a meet-cute \u2014 it\u2019s proof that the best partnerships come from deep friendship, trust, and shared ambition. On the field, they represent Australia with passion and grit. Off the field, they remind us that sometimes your best teammate is the one who\u2019s been there since day one.\n",

      "content_full": "\nBig news for European cricket! Italy has finally qualified for the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2026. For the very first time. Italy is always associated with Football, but the fact that they have qualified for the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2026 in cricket reveals that cricket is rising in Italy.\n\n\n\nFrom Rome to Hague: A Journey of Resilience, Strength, Valour\n\n\n\nItaly begun their qualifying matches in June of 2024. They were the organizers and victors of the Europe Sub-regional Qualifier A in Rome, defeating other teams such as Romania to secure a place in the regional finale. Previously, Italy had beaten Romania by 160 runs and and Joe Burns scored a century, showing what they were aiming for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year ago, Italy visited the Europe Regional Final in the Netherlands. They encountered Netherlands, Scotland, Jersey and Guernsey in a round-robin tournament. This type of an upset happened on July 9, 2025: Italy upset the Scottish team winning by 12 runs!Harry Manenti scored all five wickets of the Scottish Team, whereas Ben Manenti had performed well, which led Italy to score and increase their net run rate to +1.722.\n\n\n\nWhy does this win matter this much for Italy?\n\n\n\nFor several reasons, Italy\u2019s achievement is significant. First, it shows how much more competitive the associate nations are becoming, which many say is vital for cricket\u2019s future worldwide. Second, it is actually good to get players of Italian ethnicity with dual citizenship, and the assistance of the federation makes the process possible to consistently be able to the international tournaments.\n\n\n\nThe success of Italy proves that cricket is growing all over the world, and cricket is shifting in locations where it does not normally take place. In case Italy can win in the next ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2026, then nations such as Germany and Spain must also take their chances. Italy is also going to be able to make more people in Italy interested in cricket and to have local teams and new players because of the success of Italy in the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe man behind Italy\u2019s success: Joe Burns\n\n\n\nThe man who stood against all odds behind Italy\u2019s success was Joe Burns. After achieving great things for Australia, the former Test opener switched teams in 2024. This change was greatly influenced by his Italian background, but mostly, he decided to join Italy and play in this team because of his brother. Joe was interested in paying tribute to his departed sibling, Dominic. Today, he is the captain, and his primary reason to do so is to put Italian cricket on the world map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe displayed his true leadership qualities and showed some magic with his bat. In a remarkable display of national pride, Burns took the lead in the QLF A in Rome and helped Italy achieve the glory of qualifying. Everyone sees him as someone passionate who never gives up.\n\n\n\nKey performers behind Italy\u2019s success: From Menenti brother to Stewart, Mosca \n\n\n\nHarry are two of the best players in the Italian squad. Harry even got the player of the series award, and he took eight important wickets with an average of 9.62 in three games. In Italy\u2019s match against Scotland, he had this amazing bowling spell that pretty much wrecked their batting. At the same time, Ben Manenti put together some key innings in the same time, which gave Italy the stability they needed. \n\n\n\nAlong with some great performances from players such as Grant Stewart and Anthony Mosca, Italy\u2019s mix of spin, seam, and lower\u2011order depth worked well against experienced teams.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next!!!\n\n\n\nItaly being a qualified team to the T20 World Cup 2026 is going to compete with other 15 teams. It is at this point that the real test that lies with Italy will be observed when they are battling it out with the best teams in the world. They need to come out on top, which means that they will have to pass the group stage, the final stage, and all this will be more than being skillful; they will have to be worked deep, adjust to the situation fast, and be tough mentally. It is an opportunity to make people interested in cricket again in Italy, as far as players like Burns and the Manentis are concerned.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Italy, their qualification in the T20 World Cup 2026 is more than a sport. It is not only about being confident about themselves, their strength, and their past, but also about being wiser in playing. Joe Burns as a leader, the Manenti brothers being awesome, plus the federation\u2019s support, all came together for a really remarkable debut.\n\n\n\nWith the Azzurri ready to enter the battle in the phase of the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup, one thing is clear: they have ceased being a fringe phenomenon on the cricket radar. They are part of the story, hence their journey is only starting. Maybe they are the next big thing in World Cricket! \n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe five-day theatrics of test cricket end on a sad note. The end that brings euphoria for England and agony for India. England won the match by 22 runs and survived the fight led by valiant Jadeja.\n\n\n\nThis match was simmering for the first 3 days. The last 5 minutes of day 3 were the moment the game started boiling. After being reduced to 58 on 4 at the stumps of day 4. England bowlers ripped through the Indian batting order and historically won the match.\n\n\n\n\u00a0A tug of war across five days\n\n\n\nFrom the very first day, the match swung like a pendulum and kept the fans on edge. A rare incident happened in this test match, which makes it even more special. Both teams scored the same number of runs, 387 in the first innings. It happened only a few times in cricket. \n\n\n\nWe saw two brilliant centuries from the most experienced batters of each side, Root and Rahul. Wicket-keepers of both teams also showed consistency with the bat. Jamie Smith played a crucial 51-run knock. Pant kept his body on the line and played a defiant knock of 76 runs.\n\n\n\nWhen the match turned into the second innings, England, after establishing a modest target of 192, found it difficult with the pitch deteriorating. The fourth and fifth days were nerve-wracking as India continued to lose wickets. Ravindra Jadeja\u2019s example of stoic composure was hopeful. When India was getting underway, Shoaib Bashir\u2019s bizarre dismissal sealed the win for England.\n\n\n\nStokes and Archer\u2019s fiery spells ignited the desire to win\n\n\n\nThe 3rd Test at Lord\u2019s saw Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer script a historical end to this match. Their marathon spells of over 24 and 16, respectively, made sure that India didn\u2019t get the slightest of chances. Their commitment and determination are enough to tell about how fired up they were; they turned the match when it mattered the most.\n\n\n\nStokes delivered a masterclass in bowling and grabbed 5 wickets in the match that broke India\u2019s backbone. Archer, making a comeback after 4 years in test format, rattled India\u2019s top order with his lethal pace and precision. He showed why he has the support of his team and coaching staff every day. Their impact was central to England\u2019s 22-run win over India.\n\n\n\nJadeja fought alone like a warrior \n\n\n\nIn the game where wickets were falling constantly, Jadeja withstood the deadly spells of Stokes and Archer. His unbeaten 61 runs were the ray of hope for India amid the clouds of England\u2019s victory. He was on the verge of pulling off a miraculous win for India. No support from the other batters resulted in his heroics being in vain.\n\n\n\nHe got the spirited support from Siraj and Bumrah as India didn\u2019t fall short due to courageous resistance from the bowlers. Bumrah faced 54 balls, the third highest for India in 2nd innings. \u00a0Both fought back hard and took India deep into the last session of the day. The three stitched small but stubborn partnerships that reduced the target and lifted the hopes.\n\n\n\nWith 23 runs to win, Siraj was on the strike and he defended the Bashir\u2019s ball like a proper test batter. You cannot middle a ball more perfectly than Siraj did. The ball got deflected, hit onto the stumps, and bizarrely ended the test.\n\n\n\nFrom hope to heartbreak\n\n\n\nOnce again, India floundered in a low fourth-innings chase, a trend that\u2019s worrying in recent overseas Tests. Even though there were glimpses of resistance, India failed to form the vital partnerships at the pressure moments.\n\n\n\nIndia also suffered with 63 extras across the innings, which is unacceptable at any level of the game. They also dropped a few catches, which allowed England to cruise back. India\u2019s defeat by 22 runs, which now puts them 2-1 down in the series, raised questions about India\u2019s tactics in key moments.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChasing under 200 should have been manageable, but India\u2019s traditional fourth-innings collapses showed weaknesses with execution and temperament. The bowling unit showed promise in patches, but a troublesome lack of discipline in the field, as well as an apprehensive batting order, caused undoing. Unless these areas are addressable before Old Trafford, we are looking at the end of India\u2019s Test series in England 2025.\n",

After the signing of Joan Garcia this season in order to address their long lasting Goalkeeping issues with their Main goalkeeper, Marc Andre Ter Stegen seeming to lose his touch under the sticks. \n\n\n\nAfter that signing, Barcelona fast tracked the signing of Roony Bardghji, a 19 year old winger from FC Copenhagen of Danish Super Liga for just over \u20ac2 million along with the sell on clause included for FC Copenhagen.\n\n\n\nRoony Bardghji- Personal Story and Copenhagen Love story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoony Bardghji is a right winger who has represented Sweden in Under 17 and Under 21 category. Although he represented Sweden in the age categories, he\u2019s a boy of Kuwaiti Origin. He is born in Kuwait City to a Syrian family who moved to Sweden for better living. \n\n\n\nHe started his Youth career at Kallinge SK where he played for 4 from 2012-2015 , then he moved on to R\u00f6deby AIF where he played 4 years from 2015-2018 before moving to Malm\u00f6 FF where he showed his promising talent after joining in 2019 and stayed there for an year till 2020, after which FC Copenhagen spotted him and brought him into their youth team where he impressed the club which gave him a chance to play in the senior team of Copenhagen. \n\n\n\nHe debut for the senior team against AGF in the Danish Super Liga in the year 2021 and created record after being the youngest player featuring in that team aged 16 years and 6 days and also he scored his first goal as well against AaB in a 3-1 win just seven days later after his debut.\n\n\n\nBardghji\u2019s UCL nights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoony Bardghji made his Uefa Champions League debut in 2022 when he came off the bench in a 3-0 defeat against Sevilla. Although he had to wait for an entire year to score his first goal which was a match winner in a 4-3 win against Manchester United. \n\n\n\nHe has all total experience of 6 matches in the UEFA champions league with 1 goal only to his name. Although there\u2019s a lot of time left in his career as he\u2019s just 19 and with joining Barca now, we can expect the improvement of the player under Hansi Flick.\n\n\n\nRoony Bardghji \u2013 Make or Break move for Barcelona\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Roony is a right winger and also has the age by his side along with European experience, he can be a pretty good option for Hansi Flick on the right as a backup of Lamine Yamal and also can add depth into the squad. He is a perfect fit to replace Lamine. \n\n\n\nHe has a pretty good dribbling feet , passing sense and creates immense number of opportunities for the team and also he has got a knack of scoring as well and with all these dynamics, Barcelona fans will enjoy him thoroughly if he gets going.\n\n\n\nAlong with these promises, there\u2019s a huge sense of uncertainty buzzing around the Barcelona dressing room just because of his major ACL injury last season and his limited time this season which may create a problem with his form this season and Barca team managers may have a close eye on this situation.\n\n\n\nWhat can the Culers expect from this signing.\n\n\n\nBarcelona fans can be optimistic about this signing as Roony can be a pivotal in the team\u2019s performance as he may not be a through and through starter in presence of Lamine Yamal but he can match the same quality if Flick decides to give rest to Lamine in some games this season.\n\n\n\nAs of today, Roony Bardghji has already completed his medical test in Barcelona and he will be travelling with the first team and he will complete his pre season with them and with the training structure of Hansi Flick, he may become the player he promised to be. So, Culers should feel excited for Roony Bardghji. \n",

The glamour had faded, Messi and Neymar were gone, and Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s departure rumors were swirling again. But beneath that calm, a storm was brewing\u2014not of drama, but of reinvention.\n\n\n\nFor the first time in years, PSG wasn\u2019t trying to sign the biggest name in world football. Instead, they handed the reins to a manager known not for headlines, but for building systems. Enrique had done it before\u2014with a treble at Barcelona and a tactically sharp Spanish national side. Now, his challenge was even more layered: turn a superstar-driven brand into a disciplined, sustainable footballing force.\n\n\n\nFrom Gal\u00e1cticos to Grit\n\n\n\nPSG has long lived in the spotlight. The Messi-Mbapp\u00e9-Neymar era was thrilling on paper, but the performances rarely lived up to the hype in Europe. With Enrique\u2019s arrival, everything began to shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t demand new superstars. Instead, the club backed him with players who fit a collective system: Manuel Ugarte brought intensity in midfield, Bradley Barcola offered raw, explosive pace, and Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez solidified the backline. The flashy names were replaced by focused workers\u2014and suddenly, PSG started to look like a team again.\n\n\n\nThis was a bold shift. After all, PSG had built its brand on big names. But for Enrique, tactical clarity and hard work mattered more than global appeal.\n\n\n\nThe summer of 2024 was a turning point. With Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s long-expected departure to Real Madrid finally sealed, the pressure was on. PSG fans worried. Would they collapse without their talisman?\n\n\n\nLuis Enrique didn\u2019t flinch.\n\n\n\nWithout Mbapp\u00e9 and Messi, PSG shifted from glam to grit. Enrique\u2019s reinforcements\u2014Warren Za\u00efre-Emery, Desir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2014were chosen for their intelligence and team-first attitude\u00a0 .\n\n\n\nEnrique\u2019s Gameplanc \u2013 Youthful energy: Barcola, Dou\u00e9, Mayulu\n\n\n\nDynamic formations: A usable 3\u20112\u20114\u20111 adaptive to each opponent\n\n\n\nHigh Octane Press: Fast transitions, intelligent triggers, fewer wasted sprints\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was never about one player,\u201d Enrique said before the start of the season. \u201cWith or without Mbapp\u00e9, this team will move as one. That\u2019s our identity.\u201d \u2014 L\u2019\u00c9quipe\n\n\n\n\nA Mixed Bag in Europe, but Signs of Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the UEFA Champions League 2023-24 season, PSG made a deep run\u2014reaching the semi-finals for the first time since 2020. They topped a tricky group with Dortmund, Milan, and Newcastle, then knocked out Real Sociedad and Barcelona in impressive fashion.\n\n\n\nBut the dream ended against Dortmund, who beat them 2\u20130 on aggregate. It was a frustrating exit, especially since PSG had over 40 shots across the two legs.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe did more than enough to win, but football is cruel sometimes,\u201d Enrique said after the second leg.\u2014 UEFA.com\n\n\n\n\nEven in defeat, PSG looked composed and tactically superior\u2014a far cry from the chaos of their previous European exits.\n\n\n\n\nPSG by the Numbers \u2013 A Dominant Domestic Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ligue 1, PSG looked almost untouchable:\n\n\n\nStatValueFinal Position1st (Champions)Points84Goals Scored92Goals Conceded35Top ScorerOusmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 (21)\n\n\n\nDefensively, the team felt more solid than ever. Donnarumma looked sharper, thanks to better organization in front of him. Marquinhos and Hern\u00e1ndez formed a reliable partnership, and midfielders tracked back as part of a unified system.\n\n\n\n\nPSG 5-0 Inter :The UCL Final Scoreline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSG 5\u20130 Inter Milan\n\n\n\nYes, you read that right. In a final where most expected tension and tactical chess, PSG unleashed their best performance of the season\u2014and perhaps in club history.From the opening whistle, PSG looked like a team possessed. \n\n\n\nThe pressing was sharp, the passing was purposeful, and the movement off the ball left Inter Milan rattled. Within 15 minutes, Achraf Hakimi opened the scoring with a powerful finish after a slick team move.\n\n\n\nBut that was just the beginning.\n\n\n\n\nD\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9, only 19, scored twice with poise beyond his years.\n\n\n\nKvaratskhelia, the Georgian winger, dazzled down the flank and added a superb solo goal.\n\n\n\nMayulu, another young talent, capped the night with a fifth in the dying minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t just want to win\u2014we wanted to make history,\u201d said Luis Enrique post-match. \u2014 UEFA.com\n\n\n\n\nQuotes That Defined the Night\n\n\n\nLuis Enrique (Manager):\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the victory of one game. It\u2019s the reward for believing in a system, for trusting youth, and for staying humble.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOusmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were doubted. But today, we showed the world what PSG is really about.

This is legacy stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nA Team Built for the Moment\n\n\n\nWhat made this PSG team different wasn\u2019t just their talent. It was the balance between youth and experience, the tactical maturity instilled by Enrique, and the hunger that came from years of being labelled as underachievers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers like Warren Za\u00efre-Emery and D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9 played beyond their age.\n\n\n\nMarquinhos and Hakimi provided leadership and stability.\n\n\n\nAnd Enrique? He orchestrated it all with calm authority\u2014managing egos, rotating wisely, and keeping the squad focused on the collective mission.\n\n\n\n\nMore Than a Trophy \u2014 A Cultural Shift\n\n\n\nFor the city of Paris and the club\u2019s global fanbase, this was more than a football match. It was a release of emotion, a proof that PSG could finally be more than marketing, more than potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is for every fan who stood by us when we fell short,\u201d said Nasser Al-Khelaifi, PSG President. \u201cWe are no longer chasing greatness\u2014we are great.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nLuis Enrique became only the second manager to win continental trebles with two clubs\u2014after Guardiola\u2014 cementing his legacy.\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about\u00a0\u201cKL Rahul Shines Abroad, Struggles at Home\u201d\n\n\n\nBookmark\u00a0Sportspediazone\u00a0for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nThere are some players for whom the numbers are never going to make any sense. Yesterday when KL Rahul was going through the motions and structuring his innings together, could anyone tell that they were looking at a batter that averages below 40 or someone who can\u2019t always ensure their place in the side.\n\n\n\nNothing about KL Rahul makes sense, not his middling average of 35.22, not him being shifted around the batting order and neither does his inconsistency make any sense if you have ever seen him batting at his best. KL Rahul is an enigma of test batting, full of class and flair but never having the consistency that he very well deserves.\n\n\n\nKL Rahul\u2019s centuries\n\n\n\nIt is normal for most batters to be at their best in home conditions and by extension for most of their centuries to come in home conditions. Not KL Rahul, out of the 10 centuries that he has made only one of them came in home conditions. The other ten centuries have all come in foreign conditions.\n\n\n\nCountryNumber of CenturiesVenues (with year)India1Chennai (2016)Australia1Sydney (2015)England4The Oval (2018), Lord\u2019s (2021, 2025), Leeds (2025)South Africa2Centurion (2021, 2023)West Indies1Kingston (2016)Sri Lanka1Colombo (PSS) (2015)\n\n\n\nIndian batters primarily brought up on subcontinental pitches perform better against spin than swing and seam. Here, again Rahul is an anomaly bringing up more hundreds overseas in pace-friendly conditions such as England and South Africa than in India. He seems to prefer batting on more pace friendly pitches than on home pitches that spin.\n\n\n\nWobble ball era\n\n\n\nThe last five years has been primarily bowling-dominated with batting averages dipping around the world, batting and scoring runs has become especially difficult. The problem seems to be centred around pace bowling, with the innovation of the wobble ball which has made scoring runs especially difficult on bowling friendly wickets.\n\n\n\nThe combination of the wobble ball and bowling friendly pitches that yield results in test matches has meant that batters have found it difficult to go about their trade in recent times. These factors have probably influenced KL Rahul\u2019s sub 40 average. In any other era that was more batting friendly era, he would possibly have averaged over 40, being probably the best asset that the Indian team has on their away tours.\n\n\n\nStructuring an innings\n\n\n\nAnyone who has watched KL Rahul bat has noticed how adept he is at building an innings. Switching between defensive and aggressive gears through an innings depending on how easy the pitch is for scoring at the moment is something he has a natural knack for. Much of his skill as an opening batter comes from his ability to see off the new ball in SENA conditions.\n\n\n\nIn the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar trophy, he has been consistently putting his skills of constructing innings to good use and converting them into 100s naturally, something that has eluded him for all his career. Even his performances in the last BGT(2024-25), a low-scoring series showcased his ability to perform overseas in tougher conditions for Indian batters.\n\n\n\nIt is his inconsistency of scores and inability to convert starts that have brought about his subpar numbers in test matches. Couple that with never being able to secure his position in the order and bowling friendly conditions, we get a batter with a subpar average who was possibly destined for many more runs given better circumstances.\n\n\n\nKL Rahul\u2019s success away from home\n\n\n\nKL Rahul with his strength of playing pace and swing often shines his brightest on away tours for India. On tough wickets in South Africa, he brought up two centuries and had handy, if a little inconsistent run of performances in Australia last winter.\n\n\n\nHe is also an above par batter in India but has failed to convert them into triple digit knocks. The introduction of rank turners of late in India has not done his average any favours. While wobble ball and pace friendly pitches rage overseas and rank turners with deadly spin at home it is\u00a0 difficult for him to find anywhere where he can make those consistent runs to improve his average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistently, his best performances have come at England(with another test hundred in the ongoing test match which is not accounted for in this graph) where he has managed to negotiate the dukes ball well and convert them into bigger scores.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHis average of 28.38 at South Africa might seem low but it also comes with a match factor of 1.74(which essentially means that his average is 74% better than the mean batting average of both teams) which again exhibits KL Rahul\u2019s knack of adapting to foreign conditions and scoring useful runs.\n\n\n\nKL Rahul: The best contemporary batter averaging under 40\n\n\n\nWith KL Rahul\u2019s technical skill set, his versatility in the batting order and his success away from home it is only his consistency that has been lacking through his career. We can see how KL Rahul consistency varies through a series over five matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar trophy has seen KL Rahul score centuries in the first and third test already and has maintained consistency through the first three tests. With him holding the opening spot for the second tour in a row, some stability could help KL Rahul achieve the greatness that he has always deserved.\n\n\n\n\n",
      "excerpt": "<p>There are some players for whom the numbers are never going to make any sense.

Batting bravely and with flair to take blows and play natural attacking shorts are some of the highlights, although he suffered a finger injury on Day 1 and played it with bandages. \n\n\n\nThese two big sixes that were constituted in his innings helped him to break the record held since long by Vivian Richard of the most sixes against England in test cricket. That Pant has continued to play some good innings despite playing with such an injury is a testimony of his mental strength, not to forget about the commitment that he has to the game itself.\n\n\n\nAggression coupled with composure popularly known as Pant batting style has been one of his significant success factors.\n\n\n\nA new benchmark\n\n\n\nWith 416 runs in three matches so far, Pant has become the first visiting wicket-keeper to score over 400 runs in a single test series on English soil.

The scorecard continuously overshadowed bowlers who were match winners, reducing them to mere numbers\u2014overs, runs, and wickets. Consistency? Accuracy? Craft? Rarely celebrated. That tide is turning, and the whole credit goes to none other than Jasprit Bumrah.\n\n\n\nWhat sets Bumrah apart is his innovation and adaptation. He does not fit into the classic mold of bowlers. He is redefining fast bowling with his short run-up and unique bowling action and maximum torque.\n\n\n\nA 5-wicket haul at the Home of Cricket\n\n\n\nWhat we witnessed on the second day of the 3rd test match was not merely a stellar bowling spell. It was the display of Bumrah\u2019s greatness. England started the day with Root\u2019s century, aiming for 400. Stokes was looking solid and eyeing his 1st fifty of the series, then Bumrah came and changed the whole scenario.\n\n\n\nIt was a proper setup for Stokes. Siraj was bowling him over the wicket continuously, and Bumrah came in the next over from around the wicket. First, he hit him for a four and got humbled by the man himself. One of the greats of English batting, Root is now in Bumrah\u2019s pocket. He dismissed him for the 11th time, the most by any bowler.\n\n\n\n4 out of 5 wickets were bowled; that was categorically graceful to watch in any format. He breached the defense, rattled the stumps, stunned the batters, and awestruck the audience. It was box office; whenever he held the ball, it was like a computer calibrating all the possibilities. He executed them with absolute precision.\n\n\n\nRecord day for Bumrah at the Lord\u2019s\n\n\n\nMany records were broken and made on the second day of the 3rd match. With his terrific 5-fer, Bumrah etched his name in history and on the honors board of the Lords. When he bowled, he made others look ordinary, like they were playing on a different pitch.\n\n\n\nThe pitch was flat, no help for bowlers at all, and the way he dismantled the batters with his ruthless bowling is inexplicable and commendable. He is not just sitting with the legends but at the top of every bowling list. He is not the difference maker; he is the standard.\n\n\n\nJasprit Bumrah\u2019s average at home and in SENA countries does not make much of a difference. The only difference is the number of matches.\n\n\n\nAt home, he played 23 innings and had 47 wickets at an average of 17.19.\n\n\n\nIn SENA countries, he played 61 innings and had 158 wickets at an average of 19.47.\n\n\n\nBeyond the numbers and records\n\n\n\nNumbers can never truly define the impact, skills, and aura of a player. Records are meant to be broken, and numbers are for deception. There are many great players whose greatness can\u2019t be defined by the data.\n\n\n\nVVS Laxman, his numbers don\u2019t scream \u201cgreatness,\u201d but he always delivered in clutch situations. Jacques Kallis is the greatest all-rounder the game has ever seen. His numbers are enough to tell his greatness, but still, he is underappreciated.\n\n\n\nBumrah\u2019s greatness goes far beyond the wickets and average. His numbers are impressive, but they don\u2019t capture how and when he did it. The precision, timing, and how he turned the game on his own. He always delivered in high-pressure situations, when others ran out of ideas.\n\n\n\nShifts the cultural gravity of India\n\n\n\nEvery ball is an event when Bumrah has the ball in hand. The anticipation, the chaos, the silence\u2014it\u2019s cinema. The aura he brings is not just hype; it\u2019s hard-earned and well-deserved. India always remembers the centuries, but now they remember Bumrah\u2019s theatrical spells.\n\n\n\nYou can certainly count Bumrah\u2019s five-fors and record his averages over the continents, but it won\u2019t tell you the whole story. You wouldn\u2019t know the pressure he puts on the opposing side, the calmness he brings to his own side, or the belief he gives the team. That is why Jasprit Bumrah is not just a world-class fast bowler; he is a phenomenon that goes beyond stats.\n",

Let\u2019s break down how climate zones are changing Test cricket\u2019s tactics and how \u201cmicro-specialists\u201d are being groomed to master them.\n\n\n\nWhy Climate Matters More Than Ever\n\n\n\nA cricket pitch doesn\u2019t exist in isolation\u2014it breathes with its surroundings. Dry, baking heat in Ahmedabad means the pitch cracks earlier, aiding spin. Overcast skies in Leeds mean the ball swings longer. A coastal ground like Galle in Sri Lanka might start slow but break up dramatically if the sun bakes it for days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is why home teams often play a different XI at each venue. They know that tailoring their squad to the climate can tilt the odds heavily in their favor.\n\n\n\nIn the past, teams would rely more on gut feeling and past experience. Now, they have data: humidity levels, wind patterns, moisture retention\u2014everything is mapped to help pick the right bowlers and even tweak batting orders. (BBC Sport)\n\n\n\nExamples: Dry Heat vs. Cloud Cover\n\n\n\nTake India\u2019s use of its bowling arsenal. In drier climates like Ahmedabad or Chennai, they are more likely to field multiple spinners. Someone like Kuldeep Yadav, a wrist-spinner who thrives on dry, dusty pitches,  might get the nod ahead of a seam bowler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when India travels to seeming conditions, like England or New Zealand, the strategy flips. Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah become the spearheads, exploiting swing and seam under cloudy skies. This is why India\u2019s recent overseas wins have leaned so heavily on developing a fast-bowling unit that can thrive when the ball swings late.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngland does the same. At Headingley in Leeds, with its notorious cloud cover and soft pitch, you\u2019re likely to see two or three swing bowlers, plus a medium pacer like Chris Woakes who can bowl with the Dukes ball when it hoops around corners. (ESPNcricinfo)\n\n\n\nSpin vs. Pace: The Micro-Specialist Era\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s squads have what coaches call \u201cmicro-specialists\u201d\u2014bowlers \u201dor batters chosen specifically for a venue\u2019s climate zone. In the past, a single spinner or pacer might play every game, regardless of conditions. Now, selectors look for the right style: Do you need a high-arm off-spinner who can bounce it in dry conditions? Or a wrist-spinner who can exploit worn pitches? Do you want a skiddy fast bowler for low bounce or a tall seamer for bounce and carry in Perth?\n\n\n\nSri Lanka is a classic example. In Galle, spinners like Rangana Herath (and now Prabath Jayasuriya) have been nearly unplayable as coastal humidity combines with dry heat to break pitches down quickly. Australia, meanwhile, has bred bounce bowlers like Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood to dominate on hard, sun-baked decks in Perth or Brisbane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate\u2019s Hidden Impact on Batting\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just bowlers. Batters, too, must adapt. Subcontinental batters are trained from junior levels to use their feet and play spin in dry conditions. English batters learn to leave the ball outside off stump because overcast skies and a Dukes ball mean any loose shot could edge behind.\n\n\n\nClimate even affects mental preparation. Playing in 40\u00b0C heat in Karachi or Ahmedabad demands stamina and concentration; batters have to hydrate smartly and rotate strike more to stay fresh. In chilly, damp Leeds, staying loose and warm is just as important as your cover drive.\n\n\n\nData, Planning, and Squad Rotation\n\n\n\nModern teams combine traditional local knowledge with sophisticated data. Weather patterns, dew points, and humidity forecasts are all analyzed to decide if it\u2019s worth batting first or fielding, or when to declare. Teams also rotate bowlers to manage workloads. For instance, Australia might rest a bowler in a dead rubber in the dry Sydney heat but unleash all their quicks on a green Gabba pitch if rain is forecast.\n\n\n\nWhy Climate-Savvy Teams Win Abroad\n\n\n\nHistorically, \u201chome advantage\u201d in Tests has been huge. But teams like India and Australia are closing that gap by building more flexible, climate-adapted squads. India\u2019s back-to-back Border-Gavaskar wins in Australia proved they could win on fast, bouncy pitches, thanks to developing pace bowlers who could thrive in hot, dry climates that aid bounce and reverse swing.\n\n\n\nLikewise, England\u2019s approach of including spinners like Jack Leach for dry Asian tours, despite English conditions being seam-friendly, shows that adaptability is now non-negotiable.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nTest cricket\u2019s beauty is that it stays rooted in its environment. The same ball behaves wildly differently in the dry heat of Ahmedabad than under the overcast skies of Headingley. Teams that understand this \u2014 and build squads of players who can exploit these subtle differences will keep winning away from home.\n\n\n\nSo, next time you watch a spinner dominate on day five in Colombo or a swing bowler run riot at Lord\u2019s, remember: it\u2019s not just skill or luck, it\u2019s the quiet power of climate zones at work.\n\n\n\n\n",

His buyout clause received a significant increase, rising from approximately \u20ac58 million to over \u20ac90 million. Athletic Bilbao posted a video, where Nico made his motive crystal clear. \n\n\n\nLo que m\u00e1s pesa es el coraz\u00f3n \u2764\ufe0f#AthleticWIN #AthleticClub \ud83e\udd81 pic.twitter.com/do1QvtqYbP\u2014 Athletic Club (@AthleticClub) July 4, 2025\n\n\n\nThis heartfelt message showed how much love he holds for his home club, where he\u2019s been for over ten years.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at Nico Williams\u2019 season at Athletic in 2024-25:\n\n\n\nIn the 2024-2025 seasons, this Spanish Superstar had an outstanding season at Athletic\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 2024-25 La Liga season, Nico Williams appeared in 29 matches and scored 5 goals, and had 5 assists on the field playing with Athletic Bilbao.\n\n\n\nIn the 2024-25 Europa League, Nico was able to score 5 goals in 13 matches, scoring the winnings in knockout matches.\n\n\n\nNico played two games and scored one goal. Athletic won the 2024 Copa Del Ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams like Barcelona and Bayern didn\u2019t get this youngster: what went wrong??\n\n\n\nRenowned franchises like Barcelona and Bayern were behind this Spanish youngster. But what went wrong that they couldn\u2019t make the final call??\n\n\n\nBarcelona thought they were about to close the deal with Nico Williams. By late June, they had agreed with the salary and was set to pay the \u20ac58 million release clause. But then the whole thing got changed, the requests for delays and extra requirements derailed the whole thing.\n\n\n\n\nA report from Diario SPORT says Bar\u00e7a is \u201cshocked and angry\u201c. Apparently, after two weeks of heavy talks, they never thought Nico wanted to stay in the Basque Country. They feel like he just used their interest to get a better deal from his current team.\n\n\n\nBarcelona said Nico\u2019s agent, F\u00e9lix Tainta, added some last-minute demands like a new exit clause and a registration deadline. Because of financial rules, Barcelona couldn\u2019t agree to these terms.\n\n\n\n\nAfter this big drama, Barcelona is quickly looking at other options like Luis D\u00edaz and Marcus Rashford. Fabrizio Romano tweeted:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Barcelona are planning new approach for Luis Diaz in the next days/weeks after Nico deal off.Liverpool already closed doors to both Bar\u00e7a and FC Bayern in the recent weeks; not an easy one.Marcus Rashford also remains still keen on Bar\u00e7a move.\ud83c\udfa5 https://t.co/VIlzdLPEn8 pic.twitter.com/hxJsJiQTYl\u2014 Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) July 4, 2025\n\n\n\nAthletic\u2019s Strategy: \n\n\n\nNear June, Athletic Bilbao took action; they contacted La Liga officials to make sure Barcelona was following the financial rules. The club\u2019s president and La Liga made it clear that Athletic would strongly protect its contract rights. \n\n\n\nExtending Williams\u2019 contract and increasing his buyout clause before the July 9 deadline? The Athletic is clearly saying they don\u2019t need to sell him, especially since he wants to stay in his place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Financial Effect\n\n\n\nWilliams is sticking around, and that huge release clause? It could shake things up for Athletic Bilbao\u2019s money plans. They\u2019re already looking at Champions League cash, and this just makes their potential transfer earnings even better. If they sell him down the line, like, for close to \u20ac100 million, they could use that money to beef up the team, especially in the midfield or defense. It\u2019s a smart, long-term move, like what other clubs in Europe are doing to build themselves up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNico Williams turned down Barcelona to stay at Athletic Bilbao by signing a ten-year deal. This says a lot about where his heart is\u2014he\u2019s loyal and wants to achieve things there. Athletic is getting ready for the Champions League with one of their own leading the way, and Barcelona now has to rethink what they\u2019re doing in terms of transfers. \n\n\n\nThis whole story shows that one player choosing love for his team over big names can really shake things up for everyone involved. Sometimes, staying close to home means more than global fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It wasn\u2019t the season anyone predicted for Raphinha\u2014but maybe, it was the one he was always meant to have.\n\n\n\nIn a campaign full of new beginnings for Barcelona under Hansi Flick, Raphinha went from just another winger to the captain. He became the glue holding the team together, especially when injuries left the squad exposed and inconsistent. \n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t need dramatic speeches or viral moments to lead. He did it with effort, with presence, and with heart.\n\n\n\nWearing the Armband with Pride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen senior names like Ter Stegen and Roberto were out, few expected Raphinha to be handed the armband. But he earned it.\n\n\n\nOn the pitch, he guided youngsters like Lamine Yamal. Off it, he stood tall in front of the media after tough nights. Flick praised him not just for what he did in attack, but for \u201chow he carried the team with intelligence and intensity.\u201d Source: The Guardian\n\n\n\nStats That Tell a World-Class Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk numbers\u2014because Raphinha\u2019s 2024/25 stats are not just good, they\u2019re historic.\n\n\n\n\nCompetitionMatches PlayedGoalsAssistsTotal ContributionsLa Liga3618927Champions League1313922All Competitions56342559Raphinha\u2019s Stats This Season\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s 59 goal contributions. That\u2019s a direct involvement every 75 minutes. Source: Transfermarkt\n\n\n\nCold in the Clutch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaphinha\u2019s real magic showed in pressure moments. A hat-trick against Bayern. A game-winning assist in El Cl\u00e1sico. Two decisive plays in the Supercopa final.  And yet, there was no flood of praise. No push for awards. Just a quiet acknowledgment, if that.\n\n\n\nWhen Bar\u00e7a needed someone to rise above the noise, Raphinha showed up. Every. Single. Time.\n\n\n\nA Forward Who Defended Like a Full-Back\n\n\n\nHis goal stats are one thing. But Raphinha\u2019s defensive work might\u2019ve been even more valuable.\n\n\n\nHe chased. He pressed. He tackled. He covered for Cancelo\u2019s runs, fought in midfield duels, and disrupted opponent build-ups with tireless running.\n\n\n\nIn Flick\u2019s system, where forwards are expected to defend from the front, Raphinha stood out. And not for a flashy highlight\u2014but for work most fans never notice.\n\n\n\nFrom Winger to Weapon\n\n\n\nRaphinha didn\u2019t just adapt\u2014he transformed. Instead of hugging the touchline like under Xavi, Flick gave him freedom to roam into the middle. He became a second striker, often drifting into half-spaces, creating room for others, or finding that killer final ball.\n\n\n\nHis dribbling stayed sharp too\u2014he completed over 75% of his take-ons and created nearly three chances per game.  Source: FBref\n\n\n\nEquals Ronaldo\u2019s UCL Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Champions League, Raphinha equaled Messi\u2019s best-ever tally of 21 goal contributions. Then quietly broke it with an assist in the semi-final.\n\n\n\nHe also tied Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s record for most assists in the UCL knockout stages.\n\n\n\nStill, when the season ended, the headlines were about Lewandowski\u2019s experience, Yamal\u2019s future, and Pedri\u2019s return\u2014not about the man who actually delivered.  Source: TalkSPORT\n\n\n\nThe Inter Defeat and the Tears That Spoke Volumes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter breaking records, scoring goals, and dragging Bar\u00e7a to a Champions League final, Raphinha walked off the pitch in Milan with tears streaming down his face.\n\n\n\nBarcelona had lost. The media focused on Flick\u2019s tactics, Lewandowski\u2019s misses, and Inter\u2019s defense. Raphinha\u2019s heartbreak? Barely mentioned.\n\n\n\nNo player had done more to get them there. And yet, it felt like the world had already moved on.\n\n\n\nSource: Planet Football\n\n\n\nOvershadowed When It Mattered Most\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all that effort, for all that output\u2014Raphinha\u2019s name was still barely whispered in Ballon d\u2019Or conversations. The spotlight was often on younger stars like Yamal, veterans like Lewandowski, or big-money signings like Dembele.\n\n\n\nEven after his historic Champions League season\u2014where he surpassed Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s knockout-stage assist record\u2014he was left in tears on the San Siro pitch, watching Inter lift the trophy.  Source: TalkSPORT\n\n\n\nSo Why Was He Ignored?\n\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s not a flashy brand. Maybe it\u2019s because people didn\u2019t expect him to be this good. Or maybe the world just wasn\u2019t paying attention. But ask any coach. Ask any player. They\u2019ll tell you: Raphinha was Barcelona\u2019s most important man this season.\n\n\n\nSometimes, the best performances don\u2019t trend. But they matter. For FC Barcelona this season, he mattered the most.\n\n\n\nGive Him His Flowers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat more could he have done? Led the team. Broke records. Defended. Created. Carried Bar\u00e7a through the season.\n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t scream for headlines. He earned them. And now, it\u2019s time to give him the respect he never asked for but deeply deserves. These performances were more than just goals\u2014they were defining moments that showcased his big-game mentality and clinical finishing, even though the wider football world didn\u2019t always give him the spotlight he earned.\n\n\n\nRaphinha\u2019s Vision for the Upcoming Season\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading into the 2025\u201326 season, Raphinha\u2019s primary objectives include maintaining his high level of attacking output, continuing his leadership responsibilities as Barcelona\u2019s captain, and helping the team secure major titles\u2014especially the UEFA Champions League. \n\n\n\nIndividually, he aims to remain consistent in both goal-scoring and playmaking, improve his defensive contribution under Hansi Flick\u2019s system, and position himself among the top contenders for individual honors such as the Ballon d\u2019Or. With Barcelona building on a competitive foundation, Raphinha\u2019s role will remain central to both domestic and European ambitions.\n\n\n\nRaphinha\u2019s 2024/25 season wasn\u2019t just world-class. It was the beating heart of Barcelona. And it\u2019s time we remembered that.\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest article on Sportspedia Zone about \u201cAre Draws Dead in Test Cricket?\u201d\n\n\n\nBookmark Sportspediazone for more sporting updates and,\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n",

And why are they more influential than ever in the red-ball format?\n\n\n\nThe Bowling Coach: More Than Just a Mentor\n\n\n\nGone are the days when a captain and a senior bowler figured things out on the fly. Today\u2019s bowling coaches are data analysts, tactical planners, mental health supporters, and technical troubleshooters rolled into one.\n\n\n\nA Test match can last five days\u2014bowlers must deliver long spells, adapt to changing pitch conditions, and outthink batters who have all the time in the world to settle in. The bowling coach helps a team stay one step ahead.\n\n\n\nCrafting Game Plans\n\n\n\nA big part of a bowling coach\u2019s job is to create customized plans for each batter. For example, India\u2019s bowling coach, Paras Mhambrey, might study an opposition batter\u2019s weaknesses against the short ball, then prepare specific field placements and bowling lengths. (Source: BCCI)\n\n\n\nThis strategic preparation is especially vital in tests, where batters get multiple innings to adjust. Without a clear plan, bowlers risk being predictable.\n\n\n\nTake England\u2019s success under Troy Cooley in the mid-2000s. Cooley\u2019s detailed planning\u2014including field placements and relentless bowling lines\u2014helped England\u2019s seamers dominate the 2005 Ashes, setting the blueprint for modern bowling coaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Refinement\n\n\n\nBowling coaches are also crucial for spotting small flaws in actions that can make a huge difference. A tiny adjustment in wrist position or run-up can help a bowler regain swing, accuracy, or bounce.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s bowling coach David Saker famously helped revitalize James Anderson\u2019s swing bowling during his peak years. Anderson credits much of his longevity and skill evolution to these constant refinements. (ESPNcricinfo)\n\n\n\nSimilarly, South Africa\u2019s Charl Langeveldt has worked wonders with young pacers like Kagiso Rabada, fine-tuning their actions for different conditions.\n\n\n\nAdapting to Conditions\n\n\n\nTest cricket demands constant adaptation. Subcontinental pitches often require spinners to do the heavy lifting, while seaming conditions in England or New Zealand call for relentless accuracy and swing.\n\n\n\nA good bowling coach helps bowlers adjust lengths, seam positions, and field strategies mid-series or even mid-session. Without this guidance, a bowler can struggle when Plan A fails.\n\n\n\nThink of India\u2019s overseas turnaround in the last decade: with the help of support staff like Bharat Arun, India\u2019s pacers became deadly abroad\u2014mastering the fuller lengths needed for swing in England and seam movement in Australia.\n\n\n\nPhysical and Mental Conditioning\n\n\n\nBowling long spells over five days takes a toll on the body. Coaches work closely with physiotherapists and trainers to monitor workloads and prevent injuries. This is especially crucial for fast bowlers, who are often prone to stress fractures.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also the mental side. A Test bowler might toil for 30 overs without a wicket. Bowling coaches keep spirits up, help bowlers stay patient, and make sure they stick to plans under pressure.\n\n\n\nWhen India won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia in 2021, they did so with a severely depleted bowling attack\u2014yet the calm guidance of the coaching unit kept debutants like Mohammed Siraj performing like seasoned pros.\n\n\n\nNurturing Young Talent\n\n\n\nTest teams need depth. Bowling coaches play a key role in developing bench strength. Net sessions, \u2018A\u2019 tours, and domestic competitions are vital for spotting and mentoring future stars.\n\n\n\nCountries like Australia, England, and India now employ bowling coaches at multiple levels, ensuring that up-and-coming seamers or spinners get the right technical support early on. This system explains why some teams can replace injured stars without a dramatic drop in performance.\n\n\n\nA Quiet Revolution\n\n\n\nWhile batting coaches often focus on refining technique, bowling coaches deal with far more variables\u2014pitch wear and tear, weather, ball condition, and the batter\u2019s mindset. Their impact is clear every time a bowler adjusts his length on a flat pitch or when a team pulls off a last-day win with relentless, disciplined bowling.\n\n\n\nYet, they rarely get the limelight. Interviews tend to focus on the players, while coaches stay behind the scenes. But ask any top bowler\u2014from Anderson to Bumrah\u2014and they\u2019ll tell you how crucial that behind-the-scenes expertise really is.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nA great bowling coach doesn\u2019t just create great bowlers\u2014they create match winners. They\u2019re the difference between a team that can compete and one that can dominate, home or away.\n\n\n\nSo the next time you see a magical spell that flips a Test match, remember there\u2019s a good chance a quiet figure on the sidelines spent hours helping that bowler perfect their craft\u2014proving once again that in Test cricket, success is never a solo act.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe present era of aggressive batting and bowler friendly conditions in test cricket has rendered the art of batting out draws extinct. While run rates in test cricket have reached an all time high, global batting averages have dipped. Resilience in test batting once a valued trait in the previous era seems to have gone extinct in the modern era of test cricket.\n\n\n\nThe last WTC cycle consisted of 70 matches, out of which 4 of them resulted in a draw. Over the last 3 WTC cycles, that is 6 years of test cricket there have been a total of 24 draws. Draws have almost gone extinct in the game of test cricket with the inception of the World Test Championship.\n\n\n\nAre draws dead?\n\n\n\nThe present era of test cricket is characterised by the prevalence of the wobble ball bowlers in most pace attacks, a development which has led to a dip of global batting averages. The average runs per wicket was 29.01 in 2024, the sixth lowest runs per wicket among 56 years in which at least 20 tests were played.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelate the global batting averages with each WTC cycle and the number of draws, with it and you get a clearer picture of how batting averages have impacted results in test cricket.\n\n\n\nWTC cycleNo. of draws2019-2182021-23122023-254\n\n\n\nThe structure of the WTC has incentivized result games when both teams are trying to win the game within five days. The combined effects of the WTC structure and the wobble ball era has reduced the number of draws in test cricket.\n\n\n\nHow has batting changed?\n\n\n\nTeams have adapted to modern day test cricket in their selection process as well. The old school resilient test batters have fallen out of favour and made way for the modern swashbuckling test batters who take on bowlers, disrupting lengths and hitting boundaries.\n\n\n\nBatters like Pujara or Dom Sibley have been dropped from the international setup and made way for rising stars such as Jaiswal, Pant and Harry Brook.Slowing down run rates in a bowler dominated era seems to be a recipe for impending collapses for the batting order, so batters would rather go down swinging and make some runs in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see, how teams have made runs quicker over the last eight years, the trend is only going upward. Result based test cricket has rewritten the grammar of test batting and how teams think about structuring their innings.\n\n\n\nBazball\u2019s Boldness Backfires at Edgbaston\n\n\n\nStokes and McCullum brought England\u2019s white ball heroics with the bat to test cricket to varying degrees of success. The steep climb in the rate of runs per over in test cricket can be attributed to Bazball and their aggressive, disruptive brand of cricket.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen confronted with a mountain of runs to chase in the second innings of the Edgebaston test, England looked unsure of what to do. They should have shut up shop and played out the draw on a wicket that had looked extremely flat all throughout the test match. But in part due to Akash Deep extracting seam from the wicket and some reckless batting, England gave away a win to India.\n\n\n\nThis was not unnatural, especially from a side who have famously expressed their disdain for draws. The modern game with its result based intent has rendered resilient, defensive batting extinct which is an essential tool in any team\u2019s arsenal if they want to bat out draws.\n\n\n\nEvolution of batting\n\n\n\nTest batting has gone through an evolution in modern day test cricket. Batters are selected on the basis of their T20 performances and their intent based strokeplay. The days of blocking out balls or seeing off the new ball are gone, replaced by handsome stroke making and an intent to move the game forward.\n\n\n\nIn this era of result based test cricket, the skills of dead batting sessions and playing out draws, holding scorelines in test series are lost skills. Batting out draws seems to have become an unexpected collateral of the World Test Championship.\n",

      "content_full": "\nCricket is preparing for its return at the 2028 Olympics, and with this, a new generation of players is emerging. Almost all the teams are going through a transition phase across formats. They bowl at 140+, bat at 170, and run around the field like panthers.\n\n\n\nA generation ago, under 23 players or any player who made their international debut were looked at as rookies. Someone new to the crowd, pressure situations, and facing international players.\n\n\n\nThe picture has changed, and nowadays players come prepared and go berserk from the word go. They don\u2019t care who the opponent is; their motto is to play their natural game, see the ball, and not the bowler, or see the stumps, and not the batter. They ensure that their team wins, by hook or crook, it doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is the result.\n\n\n\n1. Yashashvi Jaiswal\n\n\n\nThe world is aware of Jaiswal\u2019s talent, skills, and maturity. He is in the rare category of all-format players. He rocked up the IPL with his consistency and cracked the DNA of batting in the test format.\n\n\n\nHe is the first player to score test centuries in the West Indies, Australia, and England in his maiden tours. He bagged nearly 1000 runs in the last two seasons of IPL. With that, he scored back-to-back double centuries against England in home conditions, and he is performing well in the ongoing tour.\n\n\n\nHe was the leading run-scorer in tests for India. Adapting according to the format is not a concern with Jaiswal; he still has to make his presence felt in the 50-over format. It is still early days for the stupendous southpaw, but signs are there for him to dominate this game in the upcoming decade.\n\n\n\n2. Dewald Brevis\n\n\n\nThey called him \u201cBaby AB\u201d before he even made his appearance on the international stage. He can hit clean and big shots without any foot movement. He was the leading run-scorer of the 2022 U-19 World Cup and was bought by the Mumbai Indians.\n\n\n\nAt the age of 22, Brevis has seen it all, from fame to trolls. He was going through a lean patch for a long time in his career. But this year seems like his redemption. In IPL, he came late to the party and became the life of the CSK batting.\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago, he made his test debut against Zimbabwe and continued the IPL form. He went bonkers after Zimbabwe\u2019s bowlers and made 51 of 41 deliveries, making the 3rd fastest fifty on debut. He has shown the promise and said himself that he wants to be an all-format player.\n\n\n\n3. Arshdeep Singh\n\n\n\nIce in his veins, fire in his bowling, Arshdeep Singh was the 2024 T20 World Cup star and IPL headline-grabber, shattering stumps with precision. With 97 wickets in 61 T20Is, he\u2019s already India\u2019s top wicket-taker. He made death bowling unflustered and surgical in an era of batting supremacy and big-hitting.\n\n\n\nHis ascent started in 2021 when he topped the wicket-taker list for PBKS. Ever since, the left-arm pacer has established himself as a consistent and nerve of steel with caps in ODIs and T20Is and a Test debut narrowly evading him. Now in India\u2019s Test squad for the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, Arshdeep is set to finish his all-format journey in the same subtle manner that has characterized his career till now.\n\n\n\nBeyond pace, Arshdeep is bringing control, variability, and an incisive cricketing mind- traits required to be a test pacer. His skill at reversing the old ball and variations in angles makes him a Zaheer Khan-esque choice. With India\u2019s pace attack on the cusp of change, he\u2019s not merely another left-armer waiting in the wings \u2014 he\u2019s a contemporary, multi-format talent reshaping the definition of fast bowling in the modern game.\n\n\n\n4. Jacob Bethell\n\n\n\nBorn in Barbados and raised in Warwickshire, Jacob Bethell is arguably England\u2019s most promising young talent. At 21, he has already made an impression in the U19 World Cup, the Vitality Blast, and The Hundred. A left-handed batter who fears nothing and a handy left-arm spinner, Bethell provides rare variation and calm far beyond his age.\n\n\n\nHe toys with the pace of contemporary cricket \u2014 bold, astute, and responsive. Accelerating in the powerplay or chipping away with spin, Bethell is the sort of three-dimensional cricketer that England values. His displays in The Hundred have reinforced his viability as a dynamic top-order presence in white-ball cricket.\n\n\n\nAbove his statistics, Bethell is a symbol of cricket\u2019s evolving identity \u2014 multi-talented, multicultural, and multi-format. He\u2019s a reflection of a sport more global, more inclusive, and more dynamic. As cricket looks towards LA28 and the future, Bethell is more than a prospect \u2014 he\u2019s the prototype for tomorrow\u2019s crop.\n\n\n\n5. Noor Ahmad\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s 20-year-old left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad is one of the brightest young bowling talents in world cricket. In IPL 2025, he had a breakout season for CSK, where he was their leading wicket-taker and dominated the middle overs. They were counting on his cool under pressure and with variations that could hardly be picked.\n\n\n\nNoor brings trickery and game-sense that outweigh his years. He does not rely on massive turns, but instead subtle angles and drift, as well as changes of pace to outsmart the batter. He showed that he could shoulder the responsibility of bowling when a game was tight and shape it \u2013 more often than not, he turned the outcome of a game with quiet and devastating spells.\n\n\n\nHe is a representation of the next generational step of Afghanistan cricket \u2013 tactical, eclectic, and composed. He has gained experience in IPL, BBL, and international cricket, which has augmented his already world-class skill set. Noor is much more than a mystery spinner \u2013 he is a certified match-winner on the biggest stages around the world.\n\n\n\n6. Saim Ayub\n\n\n\nSaim Ayub, a 22-year-old left-handed sensation from Pakistan, is changing the landscape of top-order batting with a new intention and flair. Instead of the methodical footwork, cautious play of Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, Saim has an innovative way to play with aggression that has long been missing from Pakistan\u2019s top order in T20Is.\n\n\n\nIn PSL 2025, he crushed the powerplay space for Peshawar Zalmi, regularly striking above 140 and consistently challenging gaps. His overly aggressive strike-hitting and willingness to take on matchups has made him a disruptor and forced Pakistan\u2019s selectors to reconsider the 20-year repetitive top-order template that has focused on accumulation and milestones.\n\n\n\nSaim Ayub is beyond a modern striker, and he pushes away a top-order template for Pakistan\u2019s batting DNA that has put value on pressure rather than preservation. With a T20 World Cup in 2026 and Olympic T20, Saim Ayub is not only Pakistan\u2019s future, but also, he is the representation of a bolder, faster, impacted, and global competitive process in cricket.\n",

After the last two tantalizing test matches, the fans are now excited about who will rule the Lord\u2019s ground, the Indian team, who are in great form, or England, who won their first test. This match is shaping up to be an absolute thriller, with both teams eager to grab the upper hand in the World Test Championship (WTC) 2025-27 cycle.\n\n\n\nAt Leeds, England started strong, and they won by 5 wickets, even after the Indian batting lineup\u2019s tremendous performance, but India crushed them at Edgbaston, winning by a huge 336 runs. India always had mixed fortune in the Lord\u2019s, but it\u2019s India\u2019s chance to rule in the Lord\u2019s as well after Edgbaston. \n\n\n\nINDIA vs ENGLAND 3rd Test: Squad Buzz and Who Gets Picked\n\n\n\nAmidst a lot of selection drama, let\u2019s know who\u2019s going to join the squad and who\u2019s being rested.\n\n\n\n\nINDIA: At the post-match presentation, when Indian skipper Shubman Gill was asked whether Bumrah will join the squad for the 3rd Test or not, Shubman replied, \u201cDefinitely\u201d Now that Bumrah is fit, the attack is way more dangerous on pitches that help fast bowlers. Now the question is, who\u2019ll be replaced?\n\n\n\nENGLAND: i) Looks like Archer and Atkinson are in for Tongue and Bashir. Get ready for a four-man pace attack! \n\n\n\n\nINDIA vs ENGLAND 3rd Test: Key players to look at:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINDIAN Players:\n\n\n\ni) Shubman Gill: Gill is in terrific form; he has set the stage on fire. The Indian skipper has played back-to-back record-breaking innings. Right now, he\u2019s at the top of the WTC run charts, with 585 runs and a crazy average of 146.25. It\u2019s his chance to break a few more records in the upcoming test matches.\n\n\n\nii) Akash Deep: This right-arm fast bowler has showcased his potential at Edgbaston. Akash Deep just snagged his first five-wicket haul in tests! He\u2019s now the fifth Indian bowler ever to do that at this ground, along with Chetan Sharma, Kapil Dev, Ishant Sharma, and Mohammed Siraj.\n\n\n\niii) Rishabh Pant: India\u2019s dynamic wicketkeeper-batsman has been in fine touch. He\u2019s been scoring important runs down the order, and his keeping has been super sharp. The way he attacks the game? It can totally swing things for India.\n\n\n\niv) Jasprit Bumrah: As it is anticipated that Bumrah will come back in the 3rd Test. Bumrah\u2019s lethal pace and control could be a big deal at Lord\u2019s, since the field is likely to help fast bowlers.\n\n\n\nENGLAND Players:\n\n\n\ni) Chris Woakes: Woakes is a solid player at home. He can swing the ball and score runs down the order, which makes him super valuable.\n\n\n\nii) Ben Stokes: England\u2019s captain, a real leader, is keen to dominate this series. He hasn\u2019t had a huge score yet, but Stokes is still the heart of the team.\n\n\n\niii) Jofra Archer: As Jofra Archer can come back in the next match, Archer\u2019s raw pace and bounce could pose a serious challenge to India\u2019s in-form batting lineup.\n\n\n\niv) Harry Brook: Brook is one of the most talented young players in England. He can play well and change the game. He isn\u2019t scared and can handle good bowlers, which makes him super important in the middle of the batting lineup.\n\n\n\nPitch Story and Weather Conditions: \n\n\n\nUsually, at Lord\u2019s, the field helps seam bowlers a lot. They can get the ball to swing and bounce, mostly at the start of a match. After a few days the pitch will become flatter, making batting easier.\n\n\n\nThe weather report says the weather should be okay, not too hot, with some clouds. This might give the fast bowlers a bit of an advantage.\n\n\n\nLord\u2019s history: IND vs ENG clash\n\n\n\n\nTotal matches played: 19\n\n\n\nIndia won: 3\n\n\n\nEngland won: 12\n\n\n\nDraw: 4\n\n\n\n\n4 years ago, in 2021, India won at Lord\u2019s under Virat Kohli\u2019s captaincy. Now, under Shubman Gill\u2019s captaincy, they\u2019re hoping to do it again and get ahead in the series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia and England are both ready to compete. With the match at Lord\u2019s, fans should get ready for five days for this mega clash of cricket starting July 10, 2025\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe sports scene of India has grown utterly in the last 20 years. Being the country of recognition world-wide, there are now iconic Olympic medals, enhanced performances, the country starts to settle on the global sports map at the Commonwealth and Asian Games. \n\n\n\nYet this development has not always been very systemic but more of individual genius. The problems that have been facing Indian sports which keeps it not performing to the best of its capabilities include inappropriate grassroots systems, obsolete infrastructure and poor consistency of governance.\n\n\n\nThe Indian government made a groundbreaking step and launched a new National Sports Policy 2025, the first overall policy change in 24 years. This policy is aimed not only at reorganizing development of talents helping to become a global sporting power but also improving infrastructure, professional folks strength, and motivating masses into sporting. However, as usual every policy implemented will only be as effective as its effectiveness in implementation at the ground level.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Global Sporting Performance in Recent Years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s performance at the Olympic Games has been a turning point. The Tokyo 2020 Olympics marked the country\u2019s best-ever showing, with seven medals, including a historic gold in javelin throw by Neeraj Chopra. India also made strides in wrestling, boxing, badminton, and hockey, signaling a broader base of athletic excellence. Prior to Tokyo, the London 2012 Olympics had been the high point, with six medals, but consistency remained a challenge. Source: Olympics.com\n\n\n\nAt the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham, India finished fourth with 61 medals. This was a commendable performance, especially since shooting\u2014one of India\u2019s strongest events\u2014was excluded. Indian athletes excelled in wrestling, badminton, athletics, and weightlifting, highlighting the depth of talent across multiple disciplines. Source\n\n\n\nIndia also delivered a record-breaking performance at the Asian Games 2022 in Hangzhou. For the first time in history, the nation crossed the 100-medal mark, finishing with 107 medals, including strong performances in athletics, shooting, and team events like cricket and hockey. This achievement not only underscored India\u2019s progress on the field but also raised expectations for long-term sporting development. Source: ESPN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Takeaways from the National Sports Policy 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Sports Policy 2025 introduces a structured, pyramid-based model for sports development in the country. At the base, the focus is on mass participation, particularly through schools, colleges, and grassroots initiatives. The middle tier emphasizes state and national competitions, while the top tier is designed to support elite athletes preparing for global events like the Olympics. This approach ensures a clear and measurable talent pipeline, offering Indian athletes the chance to grow through a well-defined system.\n\n\n\nAnother significant reform is the integration of sports into the formal education system. The policy mandates the inclusion of sports as a core subject in schools, along with academic credit for athletic participation. By rewarding schools that promote sports, the policy aims to shift societal attitudes and encourage parents to treat sports as a legitimate career path. This change could be revolutionary for early talent identification and sustained participation.\n\n\n\nThe policy also lays strong emphasis on modern infrastructure and opens the door for public-private partnerships (PPPs). Private academies, clubs, and corporate sponsors are now invited to co-develop sports facilities, talent programs, and events in partnership with the government. This model, if executed effectively, could resolve many of the longstanding issues related to facility access and quality training centers across India.\n\n\n\nOne of the most promising changes is the empowerment of coaches and support staff. For years, Indian coaches have been underpaid, undertrained, and under-recognized. The new policy introduces a licensing and certification system, along with career progression and incentive structures. This will not only improve the quality of coaching but also attract more professionals to the field.\n\n\n\nIn a progressive move, the policy emphasizes gender equality and inclusion. It calls for equal opportunities for women\u2014not just in sports, but in coaching, management, and leadership. Furthermore, it promotes support for para-athletes and athletes from underrepresented communities. By doing so, the policy supports a more inclusive and diverse sporting culture, one that reflects the country\u2019s social fabric.\n\n\n\nFinally, governance reforms form a key pillar of the new policy. National Sports Federations (NSFs) will be held accountable through performance-based funding and regular audits. Transparency, professionalism, and good governance are now official requirements. This is a welcome step toward reducing corruption and bringing more trust and efficiency into India\u2019s sports administration. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Will Benefit from the New Policy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthletes stand to gain the most. With improved coaching, access to world-class facilities, better nutrition, and clearer pathways, both young and elite-level athletes will receive the support they need to perform on the global stage. This also includes mental health support and financial aid for high-performance athletes, especially those preparing for international competitions.\n\n\n\nCoaches and trainers will benefit from increased recognition and professional development. Licensing and certification will create a respected ecosystem where coaching becomes a viable and well-compensated career, not just a side pursuit.\n\n\n\nNational and state-level federations, if they follow the new guidelines, could receive enhanced funding and operational autonomy. This will allow them to plan more tournaments, scouting programs, and development projects while being held accountable for results.\n\n\n\nParents, too, will begin to see sports as a serious career option for their children, especially as schools start incorporating physical education into academic frameworks. For fans, this means better access to live events, athlete stories, merchandise, and a more vibrant sports culture overall.\n\n\n\nFinally, the sports industry, including media, brands, and technology platforms, will find new opportunities in athlete management, analytics, broadcasting, merchandise, and fan engagement. The policy opens the door for innovation and investment, creating jobs and business potential across the sports economy.\n\n\n\nChallenges Ahead\n\n\n\nDespite its promise, the policy\u2019s success will depend on effective implementation. India has a history of great policies that struggled due to bureaucratic delays, poor coordination between central and state agencies, funding inefficiencies, and political interference in sports federations. Clear timelines, transparent execution, and third-party monitoring will be critical to ensure that this policy doesn\u2019t just remain on paper.\n\n\n\nA Turning Point or Another Missed Shot?\n\n\n\nThe National Sports Policy 2025 comes at a time when India is dreaming bigger than ever in sports. With improved performances on global stages and a growing interest in non-cricket disciplines, the timing of this policy is crucial. It promises a structured ecosystem, grassroots-to-elite pathways, professional recognition, and inclusive practices. If implemented with intent and urgency, it could finally place India among the world\u2019s top sporting nations.\n\n\n\nBut for that to happen, execution must be prioritized. Intent alone isn\u2019t enough\u2014it needs to translate into impact.\n\n\n\nCheck out the inspiring story of Akashdeep\u2014https://sportspediazone.com/bihar-to-birmingham-story-of-akashdeep/.\n\n\n\nStay up to date with all the information in sports world \u2013 https://sportspediazone.com\n",

However, due to some geopolitical tension between India and Pakistan, there has been an introduction of volatility, and there have been numerous discussions about the venue. To manage this situation, ACC is exploring a co-host format with the UAE acting as a neutral venue, and they may even go for a hybrid model.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDates Remain Unconfirmed, but the Pressure Is Undeniable:\n\n\n\nThe Asia Cup 2025 is expected to kick off from September 5th to 21st.

Some Pakistani news outlets are saying India will play, but Indian officials haven\u2019t said a thing.\n\n\n\nDuring IPL, Devajit Saikia, the secretary of BCCI, told the Times of India:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Asia Cup matter or any other ACC event issue has not come up for discussion at any level. Till now, BCCI has not even discussed or taken any such steps regarding ensuing ACC events. At this stage, our prime focus is on the ongoing IPL and the subsequent England series.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis comments are only raising concerns, while some reports indicate that India will participate, while others suggest that India will not. Even though there has been no official statement from ACC regarding India\u2019s participation, Twitter is abuzz with memes asking how India will play on the same stage with Pakistan after such a big incident. with memes asking how India will play on the same stage with Pakistan after such a big incident.\n\n\n\n\n\u2013Tweets are buzzing around\n\n\n\n\nLikely scenarios if India participates in this tournament:\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s title defence: After winning the 2023 Asia Cup, India will aim to repeat that success this year.\n\n\n\nPakistan\u2019s Rebuild: Pakistan may use the Asia Cup to discover new talent after inconsistent T20 performances and issues in the 2023 Champions Trophy.\n\n\n\nT-20 World Cup 2026 prep: Those teams that are going to participate in the ICC T20 World Cup 2026 can play this Asia Cup 2025 as T20 World Cup prep.\n\n\n\nWeather and Pitch impact: As a few reports are claiming that a few matches could take place in Dubai, therefore, dew may influence spin-friendly Sharjah surfaces, and late-night games will combat the heat in the United Arab Emirates. High-scoring duels may be more common on flat UAE circuits.\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next!!!!\n\n\n\nThe ACC wants the BCCI to decide by the first week of July, according to sources Sports Tak cited, so that scheduling for planning, tickets, promotions, and broadcasting can begin.

When you think of Indian cricketing icons, it\u2019s names like Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, or Virat Kohli that dominate the conversation. These batsmen aren\u2019t just athletes; they\u2019re cultural symbols. Meanwhile, some of the world\u2019s best bowlers, including Jasprit Bumrah \u2014 arguably India\u2019s greatest fast bowler since Kapil Dev \u2014 enjoy respect and admiration, but rarely the same larger-than-life hero status.\n\n\n\nWhy does this batting-first fandom exist? And is it changing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Legacy Rooted in Runs\n\n\n\nCricket\u2019s earliest legends in India were mostly batsmen. Sunil Gavaskar, the first to cross 10,000 Test runs, set the template for the \u201cbatting god\u201d idea. Sachin Tendulkar then took it to another level \u2014 generations grew up with his centuries as family celebrations. (ESPNcricinfo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a young Virat Kohli burst onto the scene, he embodied the new-age batting superstar: aggressive, expressive, and consistent. Kohli\u2019s incredible run chases, especially in ODIs, made him a folk hero for a generation who grew up watching India chase down impossible targets under Dhoni\u2019s leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuns are easy to count, easy to remember, and easy to mythologize. A 100 is simple: it\u2019s three figures, and the scoreboard shows who the hero is.\n\n\n\nBatsmen Occupy the Screen \u2014 And the Imagination\n\n\n\nAnother big reason: sheer screen time. A top-order batter might bat for hours. Fans have time to live every ball, every emotion, every signature shot \u2014 from Kohli\u2019s cover drives to his pumped-up celebrations. The longer they\u2019re at the crease, the more they imprint on the fans\u2019 memories.\n\n\n\nContrast that with bowlers: a fast bowler might bowl 10 overs in a 50-over game \u2014 maybe 60 balls in total. If they take 3 wickets for 20 runs, it\u2019s a match-winning spell \u2014 but those 60 deliveries can fade in the highlights reel compared to a match-winning hundred.\n\n\n\nA great quote from Rahul Dravid sums it up well: \u201cIn India, you miss a cover drive, people notice. You bowl six good balls, sometimes only one gets replayed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Power of Narrative\n\n\n\nCricket has always been about storytelling. Batsmen fit naturally into dramatic plots \u2014 a chase, a collapse, a lone stand. Kohli, for example, has built his legend around last-over thrillers. He\u2019s the player who \u201cfinishes things,\u201d who stands tall under pressure, who thrives when it looks impossible.\n\n\n\nBowlers do have iconic moments \u2014 think Bumrah\u2019s toe-crushers in the death overs, or Anil Kumble\u2019s perfect 10-wicket haul in a Test innings. But these stories get told less frequently in mainstream media because they don\u2019t always fit the hero narrative fans crave. It\u2019s harder to celebrate a bowler\u2019s consistency over 20 overs than a single six that wins a game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing, Brands, and Endorsements\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also the plain reality of business: big brands want faces that sell. And historically, that face has been the batting superstar. Virat Kohli is the most marketable Indian athlete of this generation \u2014 Forbes consistently ranks him among the world\u2019s highest-paid sports stars (Forbes). His batting exploits make him relatable to millions: every kid dreams of hitting a six, not bowling a yorker at 150 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBumrah does feature in major ads, but his style \u2014 quiet, clinical, laser-focused \u2014 doesn\u2019t create the same larger-than-life image. He\u2019s adored by hardcore fans and fellow players, but the average viewer wants the glamour shots: the six over long-on, the fist pump, the century celebration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBowlers Often Do the Dirty Work\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s an irony here: bowlers win matches as often as batsmen do. The 2019 World Cup semi-final is a classic example \u2014 India\u2019s batting collapse left them on the brink of defeat, but it was the bowlers, including Bumrah, who almost pulled off an impossible comeback.\n\n\n\nYet, when people look back, the narrative focuses on who didn\u2019t score runs, not who bowled well under pressure. It\u2019s a mindset that\u2019s slowly shifting with formats like the IPL, where bowlers can be MVPs \u2014 but there\u2019s still a cultural gap.\n\n\n\nThe Tide Is Turning\n\n\n\nThe good news? T20 leagues are helping bowlers gain cult followings. Bumrah is one of the first Indian fast bowlers to become a household name in the IPL era. Fans celebrate his lethal yorkers and unique action. Young fans look up to him because he\u2019s unconventional \u2014 proving that you don\u2019t need to be a 6-foot tearaway to be a world-class pacer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media helps too. Clips of a single unplayable delivery now go viral worldwide, giving bowlers new visibility. Rising stars like Rashid Khan, Shaheen Afridi, and even spinners like Kuldeep Yadav are building personal brands that challenge the old batting-only bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nThe next time Virat Kohli scores a match-winning hundred, remember: it wouldn\u2019t be possible without the bowlers setting up the game. Players like Bumrah may not be plastered on billboards as much, but among true cricket lovers, they\u2019re every bit the legends batsmen are.\n\n\n\nMaybe that\u2019s enough. Or maybe, just maybe, the future will see kids dreaming of bowling the perfect yorker at the death \u2014 as much as they dream of hitting that last-ball six.\n\n\n\n\n",

He accomplished in 8 matches what Bumrah, Shami, and Siraj could not in 148 test matches combined. Akashdeep is the 2nd Indian pacer to take 10-fer (10/187) after Chetan Sharma (10/188) and the first to reach that milestone overall since Umesh\u2019s 10-fer.\n\n\n\nBihar to Birmingham: The Inspiring Story of Akashdeep\n\n\n\nBackstory of Akashdeep\u2019s Career\n\n\n\nGo back to his initial days, when he was playing in the streets of Bihar. His father was against it, due to financial problems, and he wanted him to focus on studies. He lost both his father and elder brother in close succession. Now, he has to take care of his sisters and mother. He left cricket for 3 years.\n\n\n\nAs they say, dreams never die. He moved to West Bengal to pursue his dream, but for his mother, he was there for work purposes. His hard work and passion earned him a place in the Bengal team for the Ranji Trophy, and he consistently performed well. He was playing with one of the greats of Indian bowling, Md Shami.\n\n\n\nIn his debut year, 2019, he took a 6-fer in his second match against Gujarat. He bagged 35 wickets in a season at an average of 18 and played a crucial role in Bengal\u2019s run to the final.\n\n\n\nTurning Point of Akashdeep\u2019s career\n\n\n\nThe biggest turning point of his life was when Royal Challengers Bangalore picked him in the auction of 2022. Since then, his cricketing journey has never turned back and has only gone upwards. He was not a consistent part of RCB\u2019s squad and played for LSG this year for 8 crore.\n\n\n\nHe came in the light of Indian fans in February, where he debuted against England in Ranchi and annihilated the opposition\u2019s top order. Doing that in Indian conditions required serious talent and skills, and he has all of it.\n\n\n\nHighlights of his career\n\n\n\nHe retained his spot for the home test season against Bangladesh and New Zealand, and also on the plane to Australia for BGT. He was in and out of the squad and does not get many chances. Whenever he was in the team, he contributed with the bat too.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Remember the six he hit to Pat Cummins after avoiding the follow-on, that was a gutsy shot to play, and no one can forget his and Bumrah\u2019s defiant partnership that later drew the test.\n\n\n\nPicture abhi baaki hai\n\n\n\nHe etched his name in the history books for his memorable and valiant bowling against England. It is the beginning of his career. He proved himself and showed the world that he can bowl on flat pitches, sunny days, with the same intensity and fieriness.\n\n\n\nHe stood up when the team needed a hero to save them. Without Bumrah, Siraj was alone taking wickets and keeping the opposition under pressure. He puts his hand up and takes a maiden 5-fer and a 10-fer. He became the only bowler after legendary Michael Holding who took the most no. of wickets (4) in an innings without fielding assistance.\n\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Yorkers or Centuries? What Really Wins Matches for India\n\n\n\nHe perfectly fits into the Indian scheme of things. It\u2019s a declaration now that he could be the final piece of the Pacers\u2019 puzzle that Indian cricket is looking for after Shami since 2023.\n",
      "excerpt": "<p>The journey of Akashdeep is no less than an inspiring, emotional, and non-stop work of hard labor. A perfect script that we&#8217;ve seen in movies, where the main character went from nothing to everything. His deceptive and lethal bowling dismantled England\u2019s batting line-up from top to bottom. He played a pivotal role in India&#8216;s first-ever [&hellip;]</p>",

      "content_full": "\nCricket is a game that involves expertise, game plans, and fitness. Nevertheless, the need to achieve good results, the public opinion, and the stress placed on the person may seriously affect the mental health of a player. The last few days have witnessed an increased awareness about the need to create mental health awareness in the cricket world, and several individuals, teams, and the cricket board are trying to spread the message of mental well-being to the maximum number of people and aid the players who are not coping.\n\n\n\nThe challenges faced by cricketers:\n\n\n\nCricketers have a particular set of problems that may affect their psychological well-being. It can be very stressful and intimidating not to perform and not to succeed. A public eye can also be a heavy cause of stress. Detractors always observe and criticize the players. The game also requires pressure that is both physically and mentally draining, and thus the players are left feeling drained and exposed.\n\n\n\nThe importance of support systems:\n\n\n\nCricketers in a poor mental state need a strong support system. These may involve family members, friends, coaches, and mental health advisors. The cricketing fraternity must establish a culture of encouragement and empathy where one should not be afraid to open up and seek assistance with what they are going through. Mental Health and Cricket Organization A lot of cricket organizations are acting in an effort to raise awareness of mental health and help struggling players.\n\n\n\nTo give an example, Cricket Australia has introduced a variety of activities associated with raising awareness about mental well-being and helping players with mental-related problems. England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) too has introduced a number of steps, like a mental health helpline to players\n\n\n\nThe Role of Players in Promoting Mental Health Awareness:\n\n\n\nPlayers have a critical role to play in promoting mental health awareness in cricket. By speaking out about their own struggles and experiences, players can help to break down the stigma associated with mental health issues and encourage others to seek help. Many players, including Virat Kohli and Glenn Maxwell, have spoken out about their struggles with mental health, helping to raise awareness and promote a culture and understanding.\n\n\n\nThe Way Forward:\n\n\n\nThe cricketing fraternity must keep on collaborating to raise awareness regarding mental well-being and accompany those players that are having a hard time. This may involve making mental health care providers and support services accessible, fostering cultures of knowledge and assistance, and getting players to be open about their troubles and ask for help. United efforts will allow us to establish a more positive and accessible atmosphere for all players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Challenges Faced by Cricketers:\n\n\n\nCricketers face unique challenges that can impact their mental health, including\n\n\n\n\n Performance anxiety: Fear of underperforming in key matches can cause immense stress\n\n\n\n Injury-related stress: Injuries can be career-threatening, leading to anxiety about recovery and future prospects.\n\n\n\nDepression: Prolonged periods of poor performance, injury, or isolation can lead to depression.\n\n\n\nBurnout: Packed schedules can lead to mental and physical exhaustion\n\n\n\nMedia and public pressure: Constant scrutiny can affect a player\u2019s mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCricketers speaking out about mental health:\n\n\n\nSeveral international cricketers have spoken out about their mental health struggles, including:\n\n\n\n\nVirat Kohli: Opened up about his mental health struggles after returning from break in 2022, citing the need to prioritize his well-being\n\n\n\nGlenn Maxwell: Took a break from cricket in 2019 to focus on his mental health, citing anxiety and depression.\n\n\n\nBen Stokes: Announced an indefinite break from Cricket in 2021 to prioritize his mental health, revealing struggles with panic attacks and anxiety\n\n\n\nJonathan Trott spoke about his struggles with mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which led him to quit international cricket in 2015.\n\n\n\nPraveen Kumar shared his struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, highlighting the importance of seeking help and support.\n\n\n\nShaun Tait: Took a break from Cricket in 2008 to focus on his mental well-being, citing the need for a clear mind\n\n\n\nAndrew Flintoff: Opened up about his struggles with mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, which affected his cricket career\n\n\n\nMarcus Trescothick: Spoke about his struggles with mental exhaustion and depression, which led him to retire from cricket.\n\n\n\n. Sarah Taylor: Decided to give up cricket due to her anxiety and mental health struggles\n\n\n\nIshan Kishan: Took a break from cricket due to continuous competitive pressure and mental exhaustion.\n\n\n\nRobin Uthappa: Spoke about his struggles with depression, highlighting the stigma surrounding mental health in sports and society\n\n\n\n\nStrategies for coping with emotional distress:\n\n\n\nCricketers can use various strategies to cope with emotional distress, including:\n\n\n\n\nMindfulness and meditation: Can help manage stress and anxiety\n\n\n\nRegular counselling and therapy can help address mental health concerns proactively\n\n\n\nRegular counselling and therapy can help address mental health concerns proactively\n\n\n\nPhysical fitness and exercise: Regular exercise can improve mental health\n\n\n\nPhysical fitness and exercise: Regular exercise can improve mental health\n\n\n\n\nMental health is a crucial element in cricket, and every player, coach, and institution has to pay attention to mental health. Talking about their experiences and asking them to support the cricketers will be able to eliminate many of the stigmas associated with mental illnesses. It is high time Cricket could act proactively towards mental health and implement the appropriate support mechanisms where the players would not just flourish on grounds but off grounds as well.\n",

Group B featured higher-ranked Thailand, a passionate Iraq side, and two hungry teams in Timor-Leste and Mongolia. But the Indian women turned doubt into dominance.\n\n\n\nIndia 13\u20130 Mongolia (June 23)\n\n\n\nThe opening match was nothing short of a goal-fest. It took only eight minutes for Sangita Basfore to score the opener\u2014and then the floodgates opened.

But Sangita Basfore\u2014India\u2019s heartbeat throughout the campaign\u2014rose again to the occasion, scoring both goals to silence the home crowd and secure qualification.

Yet, some names stood out.\n\n\n\n\nSangita Basfore was a midfield general and a goalscoring machine, ending with 7 goals\u2014including match-winners against both Mongolia and Thailand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManisha Kalyan brought pace, power, and precision, adding goals and creativity to India\u2019s left flank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPyari Xaxa\u2019s 5-goal performance in the opener made her an overnight star.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoalkeeper Shreya Hooda and the backline deserve special mention too, conceding just one goal in four matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than individuals, this was a statement of unity\u2014a generation that refused to be overlooked.\n\n\n\nWhy This Qualification Matters?\n\n\n\nIndia last played in the Asian Cup in 2022 as hosts but had to withdraw mid-tournament due to a COVID outbreak in the camp. Before that, they hadn\u2019t featured since 2003. TheNewIndianExpress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, for the first time in decades, they\u2019ve qualified on merit\u2014a sign that Indian women\u2019s football is no longer content watching from the sidelines.\n\n\n\nWith the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup 2026 acting as a qualifier for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2027, India\u2019s path to the global stage is clearer than ever before.\n\n\n\nAlso, it will affect their weak international calendar and give them more visibility. Read this article\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\n\n\nIndia will now prepare for the main event in Australia in early 2026, where they will face the best of Asia\u2014powerhouses like Japan, China, South Korea, and Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team\u2019s preparation will be critical. Investment, friendlies, infrastructure, and support from AIFF and the government must now follow this momentum.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s emphatic triumph in the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup qualifiers\u2014featuring several record-setting performances\u2014marks a turning point for women\u2019s football in the nation. The Blue\u202fTigresses have not only earned continental recognition but also reignited hopes for a first-ever World Cup appearance. As they prepare for the Australian Finals, India carry the nation\u2019s aspirations on their shoulders\u2014and there\u2019s a real reason to feel optimistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese women\u2014many from small towns, fighting social norms, playing with limited support\u2014have made India proud. The road ahead is long, but the direction is right.\n\n\n\nThe Blue Tigresses are not just participants anymore. They are contenders. They are dreamers. And now, they are qualifiers.\n",

He\u2019s young, calm under pressure, and delivers match-winning performances in crunch moments. Yet, while his T20 career has soared, his Test cricket journey hasn\u2019t taken off in the same way \u2014 at least not yet. What\u2019s holding him back in the longer format?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bright Spark in the IPL\n\n\n\nIn the IPL, Sudharsan\u2019s numbers speak for themselves. For instance, during the 2024 season, he scored 527 runs at an average of 39.07 and a strike rate of 137.43 \u2014 an impressive stat line for a batter still in his early 20s (source: ESPNcricinfo). Fans will remember his fearless approach in the final for Gujarat Titans in 2023, when he almost took them over the line with a brilliant 96.\n\n\n\nHe thrives in the IPL because it plays to his strengths: quick reflexes, fearless stroke-making, and the freedom to play aggressive shots from ball one. The format rewards his positive intent and fearless mindset.\n\n\n\nTest Cricket: A Different Beast\n\n\n\nFirst-class cricket, however, demands something different. Unlike the IPL\u2019s fast-paced nature, the longer format tests technique, patience, and mental stamina. Bowlers have time to set traps, pitches deteriorate over days, and loose shots don\u2019t go unpunished. So far, Sudharsan\u2019s domestic red-ball stats haven\u2019t quite matched his T20 success.\n\n\n\nIn the 2023\u201324 Ranji Trophy season, he averaged just under 35, which is steady but not spectacular for someone knocking on the national team\u2019s door (source: BCCI). It suggests he\u2019s still figuring out how to pace long innings and tackle conditions that change over multiple days.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Holding Him Back?\n\n\n\nOne big factor is experience. Sudharsan is still learning the art of building an innings over hours \u2014 something T20s don\u2019t really prepare you for. Plus, the IPL\u2019s white ball stays true, while the red ball swings and seams for longer, especially in India\u2019s early mornings.\n\n\n\nAnother aspect is opportunity. He\u2019s cemented his spot as a reliable IPL top-order batter, but competition for middle-order and top-order spots in India\u2019s Test side is fierce. Players like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill have already made their mark, setting a high bar for newcomers.\n\n\n\nWhy There\u2019s No Need to Panic\n\n\n\nThe good news? Time is on his side. Many modern players peak in Tests only after mastering the shorter formats. Sudharsan has already shown he can adapt \u2014 he\u2019s technically solid and has the temperament to play big innings. With more red-ball games under his belt, the runs will come.\n\n\n\nIf he can translate his IPL confidence into the longer format, there\u2019s every chance Sai Sudharsan will one day anchor India\u2019s Test middle order too.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nSai Sudharsan\u2019s IPL peak is no fluke \u2014 it\u2019s the result of his fearless attitude and solid preparation. While the jump to Test cricket remains a work in progress, fans should be patient. After all, the next great Test innings could be just around the corner.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n\n\nESPNcricinfo Player Profile\n\n\n\nBCCI Domestic Stats\n\n\n\n\n\n",

From player performance analysis to fan engagement, AI\u2019s influence is growing behind the scenes, reshaping the sport we love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmarter Games: Data-Driven Decisions\n\n\n\nModern teams are using AI-powered analytics to fine-tune strategies. Tools like Hawk-Eye and CricViz help coaches decode player weaknesses, opposition trends, and pitch conditions with incredible detail. For example, according to ESPNcricinfo, England\u2019s white-ball revolution heavily leaned on data to reinvent their approach post-2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI is also optimizing in-game tactics \u2014 helping captains decide field placements or bowlers pick the right lengths based on real-time patterns. This doesn\u2019t replace gut instinct but complements it with hard evidence.\n\n\n\nBetter Players: Personalized Training\n\n\n\nCricketers now benefit from AI-driven insights that would have seemed sci-fi a decade ago. Wearables and tracking software break down batting stances, bowling actions, and fitness metrics frame by frame. These insights help players correct flaws faster and reduce injury risks.\n\n\n\nAn example is the use of AI in injury prediction. Teams like the Rajasthan Royals have partnered with sports science companies to monitor player workloads and prevent overuse injuries (source \u2013 Cricketkeeda).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Human Drama: The Soul Remains\n\n\n\nWill AI kill the unpredictable magic of cricket? Not likely. While data and predictions help, cricket remains gloriously human \u2014 full of collapses, comebacks, and moments no algorithm can foresee.\n\n\n\nFans, too, are getting more out of the game. AI-powered highlight reels, chatbots, and match simulations keep audiences engaged. Imagine watching a replay of Virat Kohli\u2019s cover drive, automatically tagged and indexed by AI.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\n\n\nAs technology evolves, so will cricket. Expect smarter stadiums, AI umpires (already tested in line calls and DRS), and even more granular player stats.\n\n\n\nBut one thing won\u2019t change: the human stories at the heart of the game.\n\n\n\nCricket\u2019s AI Era Has Just Begun\n\n\n\nAI in cricket is not about replacing players or erasing the game\u2019s beautiful unpredictability \u2014 it\u2019s about enhancing what makes the sport special. Coaches are making smarter calls, players are getting more tailored training than ever, and fans are seeing the game from angles that were unimaginable just a decade ago.\n\n\n\nStill, for all the algorithms and data streams, cricket remains gloriously human \u2014 a game where a single moment of brilliance or failure can rewrite the script. That\u2019s the real drama AI can\u2019t replicate. It can only help us understand and appreciate it more deeply.\n\n\n\nSo, the next time you see a perfectly executed game plan or a batter adjusting mid-series, remember: behind that is not just talent and hard work \u2014 but also a quiet revolution of smart technology, helping keep cricket modern, competitive, and thrilling for generations to come.\n",

The young Indian sensation has been on a roll, leaving cricketers and pundits alike in awe of his incredible talent. \n\n\n\nGill has presented himself with his lot of graceful manner of play, keen senses, and laser focus as one of the liveliest young batsmen around the globe. When the sun got over Cricket Stadium, Gill came out with a determined look in his eyes.\n\n\n\nLittle did he know he was soon to go down in the history annals of Cickerting. Like a mission, he seemed on every stroke, and the opposition left and right blowers were also at their wits end, as was the crowd that was spellbound. The manner in which he poked holes into the field with his accurate drives, pulled the short delivery with some force, and dabbed the fine leg deliveries like a pro made it obvious that Gill was in another league altogether.\n\n\n\nThe Record-Breaking Knock:\n\n\n\nGill\u2019s innings was a masterclass in batting, a symphony of shots that left everyone in stitches. He accelerated the scoring, reaching his second hundred of the match just before the tea interval, contributing to India\u2019s imposing total.\n\n\n\nRecord-breaking performance:\n\n\n\nGill\u2019s impressive performance has set multiple records, including\n\n\n\n\nHighest Individual Score by an Indian in England: Gill surpassed Sunil Gavaskar\u2019s record of 221, set in 1979, with his double century in the first innings.\n\n\n\nFirst Asian captain to score a double century in SENA countries: Gill\u2019s double century (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia).\n\n\n\nSecond-youngest Indian captain to hit a Test double century: At 25 years and 298 days, Gill is the second-youngest Indian captain to score a Test double century, behind MAK Patadui\n\n\n\nMost of the runs in a single test match by an Indian: Gill\u2019s aggregate of 430 runs in the match is the highest by an Indian in a single test match, surpassing Gavaskar\u2019s record\n\n\n\n\nThe Making of a Legend:\n\n\n\nThe path to the top has been remarkable in the case of Shubman Gill. Gill has strived his level best to perfect his art. One can see his dedication, passions, and love for the game in each inning where he plays.

This term appeared in 2022, when McCullum and Stokes started to work as coach and captain. They changed the style of their playing in Test Cricket and now they play attacking and fearless cricket.\n\n\n\nBazball Brendon McCullum-The game owes its name to Brendon McCullum, who was considered as a great batsman of South Africa. In his career, he was the player who played daring and aggressive cricket in all formats of the game. Upon his appointment as the coach of test team for England he inculcated this style to the players. Stokes has taken the concepts of McCullum to another level in that he believes in uninhibited judgments and being able to act rather than respond.\n\n\n\nHow does Bazball start?\n\n\n\nBefore June 2022, England\u2019s test team was going through a rough patch, and Root\u2019s captaincy seemed stale at that time. During this downfall, out of 17 test matches, England won only one match. The Australian team demolished England\u2019s test team by 4-0, and the West Indies also handed them a defeat.\n\n\n\nECB made two bold decisions to redefine England\u2019s test cricket and the then situation. They appointed Brendon McCullum, the swashbuckler, as the coach. He already transformed cricket in New Zealand and aimed to do the same for the England team.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s how this new approach was born; it was not just a gimmick. It started with the belief of making it the identity of the team.\n\n\n\nHow does Ben Stokes fit into this philosophy so perfectly?\n\n\n\nBen Stokes gave life to the ideas and tone of McCullum. As a captain, he not only conveys the ideas but also injects them into the veins of other players. He always prioritizes red ball cricket over the white ball. To revive from the downfall, England needed a captain who led the team from the front and made bold in-game decisions.\n\n\n\nThere are a few instances where he made bold decisions and shook the world. One was when he declared the innings on day 1 of the 2023 Ashes opener, and another against Pakistan that was also on day 1.\n\n\n\nHe sets an unconventional and attacking field, backing the players, which boosts their confidence and improves their game. A traditional and pure test batter like Root played sweep and reverse sweep shots; this is the impact of Bazball. It is a mixture of traditional and attacking cricket, where players express themselves with no fear.\n\n\n\nCan Bazball last, and is it ruining the soul of Test Cricket?\n\n\n\nThe elephant in the room, can the bazball last, is it ruining test cricket, and many questions like that. They are indeed playing exciting and entertaining cricket, which draws the attention of youth. On the other hand, it is undermining the foundation of test cricket. It is killing the slow-burn romance of bat and ball, the villainous but thrilling side of the pitch, the persistence of bowlers, and the grit of batters.\n\n\n\nDid you all notice that the pitches of England drastically changed over the last 3 years? The uneven bounce, lateral movement, and swing, all these characteristics of pitch, have nearly become invisible these days. The reason is tit doesn\u2019t suit their style of game. The play attacking shots because that\u2019s the only way their batters stand a chance.\n\n\n\nApart from a few players like Pope, Root, and Brook, most of their players do not have good defence. They fail at pitches that complement both bat and ball. Bazball has not done anything for Test cricket as a whole except for the entertainment and viewership. It only suits the style of England\u2019s test team.\n",

Diogo and his 25-year-old brother, Andr\u00e9, were reportedly traveling in a Lamborghini when a tire burst, causing the vehicle to lose control and veer off the road.

Diogo Jota was not just a squad member\u2014he was a key figure in the country\u2019s footballing rise. Since making his debut for the senior national team in 2019, he has earned 49 caps and scored 14 goals, including appearances in major tournaments and title-winning campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nPara sempre. \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddfc \ud835\udddd\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee. \u2728\ud835\udde3\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddfc. \ud83e\udd0d pic.twitter.com/JW2gxCGkZc\u2014 Portugal (@selecaoportugal) July 3, 2025\n\n\n\n\nThe Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) said in a statement, \u201cDiogo Jota gave everything for his country. He was a player loved by teammates and fans alike. Portugal has lost a part of its footballing soul.\u201d (Source: Indian Express)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool\u2019s Farewell to a Fan Favourite\n\n\n\nFor Liverpool FC, Jota\u2019s death feels like losing a member of the family. Since joining from Wolves in 2020, he had become a vital part of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s squad\u2014scoring 65 goals in 182 appearances and helping the club win the 2024\u201325 Premier League title.\n\n\n\n\nTributes around Anfield \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Uf0YHScTOt\u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) July 4, 2025\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool FC released an official statement, saying, \u201cWe are devastated by the tragic loss of Diogo Jota and his brother Andr\u00e9. Diogo was not only a remarkable footballer but also a kind, humble man. He will be deeply missed.\u201d (Source: Free Press Journal)\n\n\n\nIn a show of solidarity, the club has pledged to honor the remainder of Jota\u2019s contract, estimated at over \u00a314 million, to support his wife, Rute Cardoso, and their three children (Mathrubhumi English).\n\n\n\nOutside Anfield, fans gathered to lay scarves, jerseys, and flowers. The club is reportedly planning a permanent memorial in his honor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bond of Brothers: Remembering Andr\u00e9 Silva\n\n\n\n\nDiogo Jota\u2019s brother Andr\u00e9 Silva, who was playing in the Portuguese second division, has also sadly passed away in the accident at 25 years old. pic.twitter.com/ZRxVqHQS4P\u2014 Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) July 3, 2025\n\n\n\n\nLess well-known internationally, Andr\u00e9 Silva was carving his path in professional football. He had recently signed with F.C. Penafiel, a club in Portugal\u2019s second division. Much like his older brother, he was praised for his discipline, dedication, and quiet confidence.\n\n\n\nThe brothers were incredibly close. Just weeks before the accident, Diogo had married his childhood sweetheart in Porto, with Andr\u00e9 by his side. What should have been a summer of celebration has turned into a time of unimaginable loss.

Clubs across Europe observed moments of silence during training. UEFA announced a black armband tribute during upcoming European matches. Social media has been flooded with memories, prayers, and artwork dedicated to Diogo Jota.\n\n\n\nSupporters have used hashtags like #RIPDiogoJota, #YNWA, and #ObrigadoJota to share their grief and gratitude.\n\n\n\nHere are messages from football\u2019s biggest names, shared publicly on Instagram and X:\n\n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo (X):\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026 Rest in Peace, Diogo and Andr\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nR\u00faben Neves (Instagram):\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are more than just friends; we are family\u2026 You\u2019ll always be with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold (Instagram):\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult\u2026 Diogo, your family was your world\u2026 Forever number 20.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nLionel Messi (Instagram):\n\n\n\n\n\u201cQEPD.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAndy Robertson (Instagram):\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was a genuine, fun\u2011loving, caring person.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOther heartfelt tributes came from Jamie Carragher, Rio Ferdinand, Pepe, Jurgen Klopp, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Pedro Neto, and others\u2014even Prince William and Kate Middleton extended condolences.\n\n\n\nFinal Words\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiogo Jota embodied everything football stands for: passion, perseverance, and humility.

He was only a 21-year-old boy who began fulfilling his dreams; he was apprehensive, and he confronted the Australian pace attack at their home ground. Back then, few people imagined that one day the youngster from Fazilka, Punjab would lead Team India from the front and would break the records in England, where even legends have failed sometimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dreamy debut in Australia:\n\n\n\nShubman Gill made his debut in Test cricket for India, during the 2020-21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. In the first innings, he scored 45 runs in just 65 balls with a strike rate of 69.23. He missed his maiden test half-century by just 5 runs. His maiden test half-century came in Sydney in their third test. At the Gabba, Australia was unbeaten for the last 32 years till 2020, the actual Gilly magic came. Gill\u2019s fearless 91 runs set up one of India\u2019s most famous Test victories. That day, a new test hero was born.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rollercoaster ride of Gill\u2019s test cricket journey:\n\n\n\nAfter his dreamy debut in Australia, he had to face a lot of ups and downs, and he had to face several hurdles- injuries, inconsistency, and intense competition for the opening slot.\u00a0 Even at some point, Gill\u2019s Test career appeared to be in a state of uncertainty. Trollers trolled him for his off-form, critics whispered that this guy is not made for red ball cricket. After two years of his test debut, in 2022, Gill made his maiden Test century against Bangladesh. Gill was preparing himself for the long run, gaining the mental toughness required for the game\u2019s longest format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Trolls to Test Captain: The Ultimate Journey of Resilience, Strength, and Self-Belief\n\n\n\nLast May, one of the two main pillars of Indian cricket, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, retired. India was looking for a new captain, a shoulder of faith to carry the legacy of Indian Test cricket. On May 24, the BCCI selected Shubman Gill as India\u2019s new Test Captain. Gill was given the Test captaincy for India\u2019s tour of England, a series that India hadn\u2019t won away in decades. \n\n\n\nSince then, the trolls have been on the rise \u2013 from his stats to his tone of voice, critics have been trolling him for everything. Despite all the criticism, he remained silent, took the captaincy on his shoulders, and waited to respond with his own game. He scored a century in his debut match as captain, scoring 147 runs off 227 balls. He proved that the captaincy was in the right hands. \n\n\n\nDespite losing the first Test, he did not give up. On the first day of the first innings of the second Test match, he scored his second century of the test series and scored a double century on the second day, proving why netizens call him \u201cPrince\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new leader: The new Era of Indian Test Cricket\n\n\n\nGill runs or his records do distinguish him but it is his cool temper, quiet character, and strength which separates him.His teammates often praised him for his ability to make calm decisions and uplift the mood in the dressing room. Gill leads with ease, a sign of the trend towards contemporary success with the classic charm of Test cricket, when aggression is often used as a leadership trait.\n\n\n\nHopefully, Gill will continue his pace in the future as well. \u201cPrince\u201d Gill is slowly moving towards becoming a \u201cKing\u201d. Showing millions of youngsters the dream that indomitable determination, courage, and hard work can bring success, he is becoming a role model for the new generation. \n\n\n\nThe new era of Test cricket: Captain Shubman Gill \n\n\n\nHe once said, \u201d Just because fate doesn\u2019t deal you the right cards, doesn\u2019t mean you stop dreaming\u201d and he is fulfilling his words. The young lad who, as a debutant, started his career in test cricket at the MCG is now standing tall in Edgbaston, leading team India from the front.\n\n\n\nThis is just the beginning. Welcome to the Gill era.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nEngland, lately has resembled a battering ram in the gentleman\u2019s game that is test cricket. They have been fast, aggressive, and brutal when playing the longest format of the game. They have often doubled down on their opposition when they are ahead in the game and can pull of heists when they seem to be behind.\n\n\n\nStokes and McCullum\u2019s Bazball philosophy has reinvented the conservative brand of English test cricket that derived itself from the MCC manual. The modern English side under the leadership of Stokes takes a swashbuckling approach to test cricket, always hunting for results and never settling for draws\n\n\n\nBazball as a philosophy\n\n\n\nAlthough Bazball was pioneered under Stokes\u2019 leadership, it is in no way over-reliant on Stokes. During Stokes\u2019 injury, Pope assumed captaincy and England played the same brand of brash, aggressive cricket that they play under Stokes. Even with major architects of Bazball leaving the team such as Broad, Anderson and Bairstow, England seem to be breeding more and more talent who are always breathing down the opposition\u2019s neck.\n\n\n\nSo, how do we dissect Bazball, how do we understand how England have managed to reinvent their style of playing test cricket and manufacture results out of test matches? Their strategy revolves around familiarity with conditions, short pitch bowling, funky fields and aggressive scoring which helps them take away matches within a session.\n\n\n\nLEEDS, ENGLAND \u2013 JUNE 22: Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum of England talk during a training session before the third Test against New Zealand at Headingley on June 22, 2022 in Leeds, England. (Photo by Philip Brown/Popperfoto/Popperfoto via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nConditions and pitches\n\n\n\nBazball has flourished mostly in home conditions and away conditions in New Zealand. England has mostly laid out flat wickets which are batting friendly to suit their aggressive batting approach. Batting friendly wickets allows them to post big totals, going at over 4 runs per over sometimes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThese conditions allow them to take the game away from the opposition in disruptive sessions. A batting friendly session is capitalised on with English batters sometimes going around 6 runs per over. These pitches usually do not deteriorate which helps with England\u2019s strategy of chasing down totals in the fourth innings.\n\n\n\nTheir away success in New Zealand can be attributed to similarity with English conditions and pitches eventually flattening out. Similarity in conditions have enabled England to play their maverick style of cricket away from home.\n\n\n\nThe first test at Leeds was an exhibition of optimal Bazball conditions with a drawn out test match advancing into the final session of Day 5 where all the outcomes were possible. Ben Stokes\u2019 decision at the toss,doubted by many was taken based on the possibility of the pitch not deteriorating and chasing totals being easier.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBazball\u2019s brand of cricket is quite reliant on their conditions emphasised by their poor record away in their recent tours of India and Pakistan in 2024 where they failed to play spin effectively on turning tracks.\n\n\n\nBouncers and Funky Fields\n\n\n\nShort pitch bowling has been a strategy that Stokes and co. have returned to quite regularly to manufacture wickets out of flat batting wickets. The flip side of laying out flat batting wickets that opponents post large totals against them quite regularly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn these situations England often revisit the short ball strategy and unorthodox field settings to create wicket taking opportunities. The first day of the second test at Edgebaston saw them employ the short ball strategy repeatedly at Jaiswal, Nair and Jadeja. While Jaiswal capitalised on the short ball pulling and hooking his way past a half century, Nair eventually gave away his wicket to a Brydon Carse ball that sprang up at him.\n\n\n\nWith the absence of astute good length bowlers in their lineup such as Broad and Anderson who can extract more swing and seam from the wicket, Bazball tries to create wicket taking opportunities with unorthodox fielding positions and tempting the batter to hit out at the short ball(astute Kiwi fans will trace this back to Neil Wagner) and produce wickets out from flatter wickets.\n\n\n\nBatting Aggression\n\n\n\nBazball reinvented test cricket by bringing white ball theatrics to the longest format, scoring at 4s and 5s an over was considered an impossibility in the test cricket of old, and batting first, an ancient wisdom. Bazball disrupts game and in turn disrupted test cricket, disrespecting the good length balls and hitting them for boundaries.\n\n\n\nAverage and scoring rate of both teams on good length balls in the 2023 Ashes\n\n\n\nCriteriaEngandAustraliaAverage39.3514.97Scoring Rate3.691.82\n\n\n\nIn the current series, we saw Brook charge Bumrah down the crease banging him for four on the offside. Bumrah, who has wreaked carnage through batting lineups throughout the last year was taken on by the entire English side even though they conceded a fifer to him in the first innings at Headingley.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no Bazball without Baz himself\n\n\n\nIs Bazball indestructible?\n\n\n\nBazball\u2019s central principle has been: Live by the sword, die by the sword and that is what they have always done. Their aggressive batting has led them to collapses and losing out advantages in games where they were ahead. Their inability to deal with foreign wickets and playing spin in the subcontinent and their overindulgence and lack of patience when reverting to short pitch bowling.\n\n\n\nIn their hurry to reinvent test cricket, they have sometimes inclined their best batter Joe Root in playing reverse paddles and scoops and giving away wickets. Bazball has taken England to new highs and even on occasion plunged them into depths, but we can never say that they haven\u2019t made test cricket more exciting to watch.\n",

      "content_full": "\nIn the last 3-4 years, India\u2019s approach to the test format has shifted from bowling dominance to batting security. India just failed to participate in the final of the 2025 ICC World Test Championship, despite being the likely contenders to the title in the whole cycle. \n\n\n\nAlthough there were periods during the team tested a more of a team of batters playing XI, the major factors behind missing out on the final were not necessarily all about the defensive system or the preference in an all-round forward over a specialist bowler, but rather whether the team lost crucial series like away games and sometimes poor performance. \n\n\n\nThe management has tried to create a balance between bowlers who can do well with the bat and those who have the ability to strike 20 wickets and has to some extent achieved it but their failure to regularly claim wickets in difficult conditions particularly outside their home has largely contributed to their WTC campaign performance.\n\n\n\nThe likes of Root, Smith, Markram, and Head roll their arms when needed. They are part-timers, act as surprise elements to break the partnerships, give an extra option to the captain, and provide flexibility to the team. India is lacking this flexibility.\n\n\n\nShift in the mentality\n\n\n\n\u00a0In the Kohli-Shastri era, we\u2019ve seen how they revolutionized India\u2019s approach and way of thinking in the test format. They made India a bowling powerhouse and made us believe that we can win anywhere in the world if we have 5 proper bowling options. Kohli was a firm believer in a philosophy of \u201c20 wickets in a test guarantee the win.\u201d He transformed the bowling line-up and was very stubborn about playing 5 pure bowlers in the XI. You can question his quick changes in the team selection, but you cannot argue with his fearless mindset that gives us so many test wins outside Asia.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, this mentality has slowly faded. Recent selections in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy prove the management\u2019s defensive approach. If management knows that Bumrah will not play all the matches of the series, they should\u2019ve gone with an experienced bowler like Shami, who did excellently well on the last tour. Instead, they went with a spin- and all-rounder-heavy squad.\n\n\n\nConstant lower-order collapses\n\n\n\nIt is quite obvious that India has struggled with the lower order not contributing with the bat in crucial phases of the match. We have been witnessing these collapses for the last 3 years, no matter whether it was home conditions or SENA conditions. You expect a little bit of runs from the lower order, but it can be neglected if that order did well in their respective field, which is bowling. If bowlers are taking 20 wickets but not scoring a good amount of runs, then it is acceptable.\n\n\n\nHowever, none of these things have happened in recent years. Unless the likes of Ashwin, Shami, and Umesh\u2019s occasional fireworks, no. 8-11 continuously crumbled, resulting in giving away the momentum. Is focusing on batting depth the solution for this, which may lead to losing the matches, or is strengthening the bowling to win the matches?\n\n\n\nAre too many all-rounders wrong?\n\n\n\nIn contemporary Test cricket, a team needs an all-rounder, but Indians prefer bowlers with a capacity to bat a little, hoping for 2 wickets and 25\u201330 runs. This tends to hinder wicket-taking potential.\n\n\n\nWhat India\u2019s Test strategy lacks is the creation of batters who can bowl well, such as Joe Root or Travis Head. These top-order batsmen might not be frontline bowlers, but their roles in particular situations, like breaking partnerships and supporting primary bowlers, are critical.\n\n\n\nThe bigger question is\u2014why aren\u2019t young batters being trained to bowl 5\u20136 overs a day? Why isn\u2019t the domestic circuit emphasizing dual-skill players? India could create batters who bring bowling depth, enabling five full-time bowlers to bowl more freely.\n\n\n\nConsequences\n\n\n\nReliance on batting bowlers means short-term stability but long-term structural issues. In Test cricket, particularly away from the subcontinent, taking 20 wickets is imperative. Weakening bowling quality in the disguise of batting depth nullifies a team\u2019s primary pathway to victory.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s recent foreign defeats illustrate this\u2014when a bowler has a bad day or is injured, the side is short of an asset. Lacking a part-timer in the top order, the other bowlers end up with unsustainable workloads, resulting in successful spells becoming much harder to come by and possible injuries in long series. It also limits the tactical freedom of the captain. A part-timer can be used as a successful surprise factor, particularly in pressure situations.\n\n\n\nLacking additional bowling options from the top order makes the Indian attack prone to flat wickets, as witnessed in drawn tests, where they find it difficult to keep the pressure on. England and Australia are favored by the fact that they have numerous bowling options, and so flexibility is retained even when some are not effective. India must look beyond its emphasis on \u201cbowlers who bat\u201d and invest in multi-dimensional batsmen who can bowl well.\n",
      "excerpt": "<p>In the last 3-4 years, India\u2019s approach to the test format has shifted from bowling dominance to batting security.

The reason of this love affair of football fans with this new edition of Club World Cup consists of two reasons \u2013 High competative matches where we can see the surprise package of the Non European teams which they have showcased against the strong European Sides like Al Hilal, Flamengo. \n\n\n\nAn another reason is the performance of the Young Prodigies for both European and Non European teams, but out of all youngster, there is one youngster who shown out the brightest among all, named Gonzalo Garcia Torres.\n\n\n\nWho is Gonzalo Garcia?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how\u2026 I just want to score. Left foot, right foot, header\u2026 just score!\u201d says Gonzalo Garcia after scoring against Juventus in the Round of 16 of the Fifa Club World Cup.\n\n\n\n\nGonzalo Garcia is a 21 year old Spanish Striker who has broken out to scene in this Club World Cup through his poacher like finishing in and around the box and had came up with the impressive numbers of 3 goals and an assist in the Club World Cup this season and has been the star of the scene since the beginning. \n\n\n\nAlthough he is the star of the hour, the game has not been kind to him. He has been a product of Real Madrid Castilla, the academy of Real Madrid and has impressed the club while coming through the ranks in the academy. He has scored impressive 30 goals in his Real Madrid Castilla youth career and has got the huge attention of the senior team when he scored 25 goals in 36 games in the Primera Federaci\u00f3n last season. He has also been the part of Spain U-19 team has 10 matches under his belt as well.\n\n\n\nHe has been with the senior team since the start of the last season but mostly he has been on the bench but still have got 3 matches in his senior career, all from the bench but now in the Club World Cup, he got the chance of being the starter in the absence of Kylian Mbappe and without a doubt, he has given the full return to the trust which has been shown by the management.\n\n\n\nWhy is he so important for the Future of Real Madrid?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlways pointing at the badge\u201d states Fabrizio Romano in his Instagram Post for Gonzalo Garcia.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.fotmob.com/players/1413847/gonzalo-garcia\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Gonzalo is in the dawn of his career, he can play a huge role in rebuilding the attack of Real Madrid, especially in Xabi Alonso\u2019s system. He\u2019s a proper number 9 who craves for goals. In this Club World Cup, his stats justifies why Real Madrid should consider him for the future as well for the present. \n\n\n\nAccording to FotMob, he has got a staggering xG(expected goal ratio) of 2.05 with his 3 goals and also has got a xGOT(expected on target ratio) of 1.40 with 6 shots on target among the 9 shots he shot towards goal, this can grow better in future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the rumours, Real Madrid may look to release Rodrygo and in the absence of Rodrygo, Xabi Alonso can use Kylian Mbappe in the position of Rodrygo on the right and due to that Gonzalo may become the striker Xabi Alonso is looking for as he has got good positioning sense and also the ariel ability even after not being the tallest of guys. \n\n\n\nNot only the goal scoring ability, he has got a good passing range which may help Real Madrid in the build up while attacking as he has got a passing accuracy of 77.2% and has also created 3 chances in this Club World Cup which can improve as he plays at this level regularly and most importantly, he is just 21 and still away from his prime and with the age on his side and with a coach like Xabi Alonso, he can reach the heights of his potential and may become one of the biggest prospects in World Football.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe stats, the grit, the mentality and the passion \u2013 Gonzalo Garcia has it all. The way he is showing up to the biggest of stages when the eyeballs of the world are on him, he is stepping up to the occasions time and time again and because of him, Madridistas didn\u2019t miss the giant presence of Kylian Mbappe and with the rise in the stature and maturity, Madrid fans can expect something huge from one of his home grown boy. From a boy who dreamt in Castilla can make the world stand on their feet. A boy who has whites in his veins \u2013 Gonzalo Garcia.\n",

      "content_full": "\n\u201cNo Fixtures, No Future? The Troubling Void in Indian Women\u2019s Football Schedule\u201d\n\n\n\nHalfway through 2025, the Indian women\u2019s national football team has taken the field just ten times. That\u2019s not a typo. Ten matches\u2014including friendlies, a brief run in the Pink Ladies Cup, AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup qualifiers, and SAFF Championship appearances. According to Khel Now, that\u2019s been the extent of competitive exposure for one of South Asia\u2019s most high-profile women\u2019s teams.\n\n\n\nNow compare that to what\u2019s happening just across the border.\n\n\n\nIn early 2025, Nepal didn\u2019t just wait for tournaments to happen \u2013 they hosted one. A four-nation women\u2019s tournament brought valuable international action to their players, with opponents and atmospheres that challenged and motivated the team. As reported on Reddit, this move wasn\u2019t just symbolic \u2013 it gave Nepal\u2019s players the minutes that matter. \n\n\n\nBangladesh has also kept its women\u2019s squad active. The team played seven matches in the 2024 SAFF Women\u2019s Championship alone, and that\u2019s not counting additional qualifiers and friendlies they\u2019ve had. It\u2019s clear that Bangladesh is making sure their women\u2019s team is match-fit and internationally exposed \u2014 not just on paper, but on the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, back home, the Indian Women\u2019s League (IWL) continues to serve as the main source of competitive games for domestic players. But the IWL runs only for a few months, and even then, it can\u2019t make up for the lack of consistent national team fixtures. As The Away End points out, players simply aren\u2019t getting enough game time to develop or compete at a serious level.\n\n\n\nIndia Has the Tools, Others Have the Will\n\n\n\nThis gap hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by fans. On r/IndianFootball, users point out how in 2023, the women\u2019s team didn\u2019t play a single friendly outside of tournaments. That kind of absence doesn\u2019t just hurt rankings-it breaks momentum. Another thread (r/IndianFootball) highlights the same frustration: the talent is there, but the opportunities just aren\u2019t.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s striking is that India, with more infrastructure, a higher FIFA ranking, and a deeper player pool, is still falling behind countries like Nepal and Bangladesh \u2013 at least when it comes to match exposure. It\u2019s not just about funding or resources anymore. It\u2019s about scheduling, commitment, and making sure that international football for women is more than an occasional event.\n\n\n\nWhile India has the resources, the infrastructure, and a steadily growing fan base, it\u2019s Nepal and Bangladesh who are doing more with less. They\u2019re building calendars. They\u2019re putting their players in real-game situations. They\u2019re choosing action over potential.\n\n\n\nNepal and Bangladesh are playing. Why Isn\u2019t India?\n\n\n\nThe contrast becomes more evident when noting that while India may boast better FIFA rankings and domestic infrastructure on paper, it is Nepal and Bangladesh that are consistently offering their national women\u2019s teams more playing time. This gap in fixture load is a clear indicator of the differing strategic priorities among South Asian football federations when it comes to women\u2019s football.\n\n\n\nIn international football, calendars matter. They shape careers, sharpen teams, and build confidence. More importantly, they send a message \u2013 that the team matters, that the investment is real, and that the future is being taken seriously. Unfortunately, India\u2019s women\u2019s team is still waiting for that message to become a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the athletes who wear the Indian badge, the motivation to represent the country has never wavered. They continue to train, compete, and dream \u2013 even when the system gives them so few chances to show what they\u2019re capable of. Many of these women juggle careers, academics, and family expectations, often without the support systems that male athletes enjoy. What they need is a structure that respects their time, their talent, and their commitment.\n\n\n\nThe difference in match calendars might seem like a numbers game, but for the players \u2013 and the future of the sport \u2013 it\u2019s about opportunity.\n",

It made a huge impact on the minds of little girls across the country. In its first season (2023), it went beyond the expectations of everyone. It provided momentum to revolutionize Women\u2019s Cricket in the very first edition.\n\n\n\nMany people wonder why WPL is so necessary for the growth of women in this beautiful sport. As we all know, India loves cricket so much, and treats this game as their religion, sees it with utmost love and passion, and considers its players as their own; they feel a connection with them.\n\n\n\nIPL is the perfect example of this statement; it\u2019s been 16 years, and it is the most successful and biggest league in the world. It gives us so many talented and future stars such as Bumrah, Ishan, Hardik, Chahal, and many more. WPL is going to play the same role and will help Women\u2019s cricket to reach new heights and wings to fly high and achieve all the success.\n\n\n\nNow, Indian women cricketers have the experience of playing in crowded stadiums and know how to control their nerves in difficult situations, all thanks to the WPL. Youngsters like Shafali, Sarvani, Shreyanka, Kanika, and Saika learn to deal with the highs and lows of the game from Lanning, Healy, Perry, Divine, and so many legendary players and coaches. \n\n\n\nShreyanka had a wonderful season with bat and ball, Kanika played some crucial knocks as a middle-order batter for RCB, and Saika played a vital role in leading MI to its first title win. These young talents lit up the stadiums with their power-packed batting and bowling performances.\n\n\n\nKashvee Gautam\n\n\n\nIn the recent season of WPL, Gujarat Giants\u2019 pace bowling all-rounder had everyone in awe. She missed the last season and made sure to come back with a bang this season. No one can forget when she hit the winning six on Shabnam Ismail\u2019s ball. She also celebrated in front of her, an uncapped Indian doing all of it in the face of the fastest bowler of women\u2019s cricket was a sight to watch. Gautam impressed everyone with her controlled line, length, and speed variations. \n\n\n\nShe can constantly attack the stumps, can swing the ball, and can do the power hitting down the order. In this WPL, she is the leading Indian wicket-taker with 11 wickets at an economy of 6.45. Her dismissal of Lanning was one of the best moments of WPL. You have to be at your very best to beat and bowl one of the greatest batters of Women\u2019s cricket. Kashvee has all the skills needed and the potential to be India\u2019s next star all-rounder.\n\n\n\nShreyanka Patil\n\n\n\nThe star all-rounder of India made her debut for RCB in the inaugural season of WPL in 2023. She has established herself as the key player for the Indian team in a 2-year short span. Patil earned her position in the team by continuously performing in domestic and WPL. She clinched 19 wickets in two seasons, unfortunately, didn\u2019t play this year due to injury. \n\n\n\nOut of those 19 wickets, she took 13 in the last season and had a key contribution to RCB\u2019s maiden title win. The one thing that would make her one of the best all-rounders in the future is that she thrives under pressure. There are so many moments in WPL, where she rises under pressure and snatches the victories for her team.\n\n\n\nSaika Ishaque\n\n\n\nThe Mumbai Indians star and asset of the 2023 title win, Saika Ishaque, was one of the biggest revelations of this league. She took a 4-fer in her debut match and a total of 15 wickets at a mind-blowing economy of 7 in 10 matches. She grew up playing cricket on the streets of Kolkata, and her father was her biggest supporter. \u00a0\n\n\n\nShe wreaked havoc with her left-arm spin bowling in the 2023 WPL and dismissed some of the big names of the league, such as Sophie Devine, Meg Lanning, Healy, and Shafali Verma. In the 2025 season, her form took a bad dip, and she didn\u2019t do well. You cannot write the name off of a skilled player like her, because she knows how to make a comeback. \u00a0\n\n\n\nTitas Sadhu\n\n\n\nShe is the hero of the U-19 World Cup and had a major contribution to India\u2019s maiden U-19 title win. She showcased her temperament and performed best under pressure when she delivered her match-winning spell of 2/6 in four overs in the final of the U-19 World Cup.\n\n\n\nSadhu is a prodigy and one of the brightest young talents of Indian women\u2019s Cricket. With the ability to hit the deck hard, swing the ball, and maturity beyond her age, she stands one level above the others.Although she joined Delhi Capitals, she has yet to make her on-field debut in 2025 and has no WPL stats this season.\n\n\n\nShree Charani\n\n\n\nThe star of India\u2019s first win over the hosts in the ongoing series between England and India. Charani\u2019s dream debut spell of 4/12 in 3.5 overs made her the second Indian after S Naidu\u2019s 4/9 in 3 overs against Bangladesh. Her memorable spell in India\u2019s thumping win of 97 runs over England made it the 4th largest victory in terms of runs. \n\n\n\nShe dismantles England\u2019s experienced batting line-up with her variations in pace. In the 2nd of the series, she secured 2 wickets and helped in taking the lead of 2-0 in the series. She showed a lot of promise and potential in this series, and it will be interesting to watch how she performs in the remaining matches.\n\n\n\n\n",

Since this season (2024-2025), however, the number of matches has grown. \n\n\n\nPost more inclusion of the Club World Cup by FIFA where the most popular clubs of any country of any continent are participating and also in the past due to the concept of the new UEFA Champions League system, where before the tournament involved used to go in a group-wise format where the teams could be assured about the number of matches they will play in the group stage except knockouts and last due to the new concept of playoffs introduced to the teams. \n\n\n\nIt finished between the numbers 9 and 24 in the round robin table of the Champions League, due to which the teams have to play more games than before along with their national leagues of that particular country.\n\n\n\nImportance of Workload Management \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workload management has also begun to play an important role in determining the success of a team as matches have also gone up. Today, the teams are required to enter the minimum of three tournaments in a season. The National League is like La Liga of Spain and the Premier League of England.\n\n\n\nThe National Cup event, like the Copa del Rey of Spain and FA Cup of England and the Continental tournament, like the UEFA Champions League or Europa league and the other tournaments like the Spanish Super Cup and Community Shield or Carabao Cup and now the debut of the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the Club World Cup. \n\n\n\nThis has seen the players play more matches hence raising the chances of sustaining an injury since they will be playing more matches both with their clubs and with their respective national teams in the schedule to be playing in the international break in football. With this long program, teams and their officiating staff and management must keep in consideration the workload of the players to be able to schedule their training and resting time so that they can play at their best.\n\n\n\nConsequences of Poor Workload Management \n\n\n\nAs the new system was introduced before the last season kicked off, the teams seemed not to be fully prepared for this type of hefty schedule which led to the less efficient management of workload of the players which brought a huge number of injuries for the teams which affected the teams in their respective campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast season, teams like Real Madrid and Manchester City suffered due to injury throughout the season, which affected their trophy cabinet as well by missing out on key players. Real Madrid lost main players such as Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao throughout the entirety, and this could have affected their season, making them miss out on La Liga by finishing 2nd on the table with 84 points, which was 4 points behind the winners. \n\n\n\nFC Barcelona, who won La Liga with 88 points, exited the UEFA Champions League at the quarterfinal stage, losing to Arsenal 5-1 on aggregate of the 2 legs of the tie, and ended in 2nd place in the Copa Del Rey tie losing 3-2 to FC Barcelona in the final.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Manchester City\u2019s campaign struggled rigorously due to the injuries of players like Rodri, Savinho, and Akanji. The record straight 4 times Premier League champions and the 2023 UEFA Champions League champions finished 3rd in the Premier League table finishing 13 points behind the league leaders, Liverpool with 71 points and they also crashed out of the Champions League playoff against Real Madrid 6-3 on aggregate.\n\n\n\nNot only these two teams, but teams like Barcelona have suffered due to the injury which led to their crashing out from the Champions League semi-final when they lost both of their important fullbacks\u2014Jules Kounde and Alejandro Balde\u2014who played a crucial role in their success for the rest of the season and helped them to clinch the La Liga title and Copa del Rey title and add the Spanish Super Cup title and well to their cabinet.\n\n\n\nTeams\u2019 preparation to address and manage the issue ahead of the New Season \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe teams are strengthening their teams by investigating the format of the football season. They are bringing in new tailored training regimes and reinforcement sessions to an entire squad as well as to the injury-prone members of the team like Dani Olmo or the ones playing in risky ways like Lamine Yamal, in the case of asking them a query about reducing the chances of getting an injury. \n\n\n\nThe coaches are taking care of the rest of the team and because of that clubs are getting compelled to sign-up players not only in key positions of a team but also in backup positions which will improve the quality and depth of the entire squad and the best example of doing so in haste is illustrated at The coaches and physios are putting in place diet plans and strength training among the players and collecting statistics of every player on the team.\n\n\n\nConclusion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the days are passing by, the beautiful sport of football is bringing itself into a newer, better and tougher form. Although it is nothing short of a treat to the viewers all across the world, due to this increase in number of high intensity games, players are getting less rest, which may cause injury which can be career-threatening to them.\n\n\n\nWe have seen many players getting their careers drowned by a massive injury and to prevent these things, the management of the players and their workload becomes very important, not only for the team but also for football itself.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nModern wicketkeepers in test cricket embody a fearlessness that is uncharacteristic of batters in a bowling dominated era. Bowling friendly pitches, the change in the Kookaburra ball and wobble seam bowling has brought along what has been dubbed as the pace playing pandemic by cricket writers worldwide.\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s wicketkeepers coming in to bat at 5 or 6(just when the ball is getting a little weathered) usually opt to smash the ball out of the park, taking the bowlers on and making the best out of their late entry points into the game.\n\n\n\nWicketkeeping batters to Batting Wicketkeepers\n\n\n\nCast your mind a few decades back and think about wicketkeepers in the 2000s or the early 2010s, chances are the names that come to mind are Mark Boucher, MS Dhoni, or Adam Gilchrist. While Gilly was an exception, whose batting style later became the blueprint of our modern batting wicketkeepers.\n\n\n\nWicketkeepers were mostly picked on the basis of their wicketkeeping skills and being a handy bat at No.7 and an ability to bat with the tail. It was still considered the best strategy to pick the best gloveman in your country, notwithstanding their batting skills if your top order and middle order could sufficiently pile on runs.\n\n\n\nConsider the examples of the following keepers:\n\n\n\n\nMark Boucher averaging 30.30 with a career SR of 50.11\n\n\n\nAlec Stewart averaging 39.54 with a career SR of 48.66\n\n\n\nMS Dhoni averaging 38.09 with a career SR of 59.11\n\n\n\n\nThese are keepers with modest batting averages who weren\u2019t too aggressive lest they should lose their wicket batting with the tail. This small list features two of the most successful wicketkeepers in international cricket namely Boucher and Dhoni.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat did Gilly do?\n\n\n\nGilchrist set the blueprint for Modern test batting\n\n\n\nNow let us come to Adam Gilchrist\u2019s numbers who came in for Australia at No.7 and averaged 47.60 with a career SR of 81.95. Bolstered by Australia\u2019s impeccable top order and middle order, he played freely and took any bowling attack he saw in front of him and smashed them out of the park.\n\n\n\nApart from his late entry point and confidence in his top order, Gilchrist saw his position in the team as the wicketkeeper as his surety for his aggressive batting style. Gilly\u2019s presence down the order innovated batting for wicketkeepers something that we are seeing today with contemporary wicketkeepers such as Jamie Smith, Alex Carey and most notably Rishabh Pant.\n\n\n\nWhat happened last week?\n\n\n\nThe previous week in test cricket featured multiple knocks that exhibit the point that I\u2019m trying to make.\n\n\n\n\nRishabh Pant- 134(178) striking at 75.28 in the first innings\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0                              118(140) striking at 84.28 in the second innings\n\n\n\n\nJamie Smith- 40(52) striking at 76.92 in the first innings\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0                     44(55) striking at 80.00 in the second innings\n\n\n\n\nAlex Carey- 65(75) striking at 86.66 in the second innings\n\n\n\n\nJamie Smith and Alex Carey come in to bat at No.7 and have shown aggressive intent when faced with aggression and threat from the bowling end. Old school wicketkeepers would have been content to keep the ball out and keep the scoreboard ticking, while these wicketkeepers take on the bowlers and score useful runs as quickly as they can.\n\n\n\nWith bowling strike rates being their all time lowest in 2024, batters have often chosen to attack rather than defend knowing that they will go out sooner rather than later. Gone are the days of Dravid, Pujara, and Cook because while averages seemed to be falling, run-rates hit an all time high in 2024 with 3.65 runs being scored per over.\n\n\n\nBatting Wicketkeepers\n\n\n\nRishabh Pant has quite clearly modelled his batting style after Adam Gilchrist, averaging 44.44 and striking at 74.03, he is the quintessential aggressive batting wicketkeeper of modern times. Yet, while these wicketkeepers have managed to impact the game positively with the bat, their keeping seems to be suffering.\n\n\n\nWhile earlier teams would pick up the best gloveman in the country based on their keeping skills, with top 6 averages at an all time low, teams are looking to pick up batters who can keep wicket. England dropping Ben Foakes for Jamie Smith or Ollie Pope as their wicketkeeper tells us that they\u2019d rather pick the extra bat than the best keeper in the country.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just England, we have seen India opting for Pant over other keepers such as Wriddhiman Saha or KS Bharat because of his flair with the bat. Now Dhruv Jurel, another promising keeper-batter is waiting in the stands for his chance and with Pant\u2019s recent success with the bat, can India not just play him as a batter and give the gloves to Jurel.\n\n\n\nThe curious case of Johnny Bairstow\n\n\n\nGilchrist always maintained that he could keep playing his attacking style of cricket because his keeping assured him a spot in the Australian side. Jonny Bairstow, a major proponent of England\u2019s Bazball side found his average slipping when he was picked only as a batter and not the keeper.\n\n\n\nBairstow\u2019s average dropped from 37.63 when he was the designated keeper to 34.93 when he was picked only as a batter. His form dried up, his runs dried up and eventually he was dropped from the side after the India tour early in 2024.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRishabh Pant may suffer something similar if he is picked only as a batter, or it may even go the other way, bolstered by the confidence shown by his selectors he may go all out, improving his batting in the absence of his keeping duties, but is it worth risking the enigma that is Rishabh Pant in test cricket?\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nModern test batting travails have encouraged the birth of batting wicketkeepers like Pant, Smith, and Carey. Teams need a reliable 7th batter who can put runs on the board on spicy wickets where bowlers are running rampant.\n\n\n\nWicketkeeping is a skill that cannot be measured or analysed beyond caught behinds or stumpings but we have managed to analyse every nitty gritty behind the art of batting. Amid test batting woes, we may be losing our specialist keepers to batting wicketkeepers.\n",

Marks reports multiple executives warned: \u201cYou\u2019d mortgage your next five summers\u201d\u2014cap-strangled by one-season splurge for a nearly-41-year-old.\n\n\n\nLeBron\u2019s decline in defensive speed and recovery metrics (2024) stands in contrast to his prime years. Historical parallels\u2014like Kobe\u2019s untradeable $48\u202fM deal at 37\u2014highlight the trap of aging mega-salaries. At this stage, he labels him a negative asset: halo effects off the court, but diminishing returns on it.\n\n\n\nLeBron\u2019s off-court leverage is legendary. As Windhorst and Lowe discussed, his roster demands\u2014plus Rich Paul\u2019s history (Davis, Irving)\u2014add control friction for acquiring teams\u2002. No GM wants to draft picks just to support someone else\u2019s vanity project.\n\n\n\nTHE COUNTERFIRE\n\n\n\nLeBron\u2019s 2024 postseason line\u201425/7/8 on 57% TS in WCF\u2014keeps him in elite territory. A rival coach blurted: \u201cPut him on Denver and they three\u2011peat. Period.\u201d His playoff dominance still moves the needle when it matters.\n\n\n\nThe revenue lift is real: jersey sales, gate spikes and sponsor premiums still soar when LeBron\u2019s in town. Shams Charania and Adrian Wojnarowski report that \u201cthree contending GMs\u201d are whispering interest behind closed doors.\n\n\n\nEven at 34, Kevin Durant fetched four first-rounders plus Mikal Bridges, setting a precedent for aging stars retaining trade value. LeBron, older but statistically superior in many categories, could command a different kind of package\u2014not picks, but instant title equity. As Chris Haynes put it: \u201cLeBron\u2019s value isn\u2019t in picks\u2014it\u2019s in rings.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest\u2014has he ever lacked leverage?\n\n\n\nWHY THIS DEFINES A NEW ERA\n\n\n\nThe CBA\u2019s second apron now significantly restricts spending flexibility\u2014something apparent in ex-exec quotes that draft picks don\u2019t always matter anymore; cap-cap paralysis has set in. If superstars like LeBron can no longer be moved, the model shifts: mega-contracts become career immovables rather than team assets.\n\n\n\nLegacy is on the line. Do legends now end their careers stuck or sidelined? Will icons like Kobe and MJ become relics? The fanbase is a storm of emotion:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLakers Nation burning Marks jerseys \ud83d\udd25\u201d\u201cHe forgot the 2016 parade? Come on!\u201d\u201cSince when do playoff producers lose value in June?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t a sideshow\u2014it signals a tectonic shift in how players and teams view value beyond stats alone.\n\n\n\nFinal Words \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the cold truth: LeBron remains a top-tier performer\u2014but the cap era turned him into a terrible trade asset. His future may stay tethered to either nostalgia or championship chasing; the Lakers know they\u2019re holding the cards. So, I\u2019ll lean on wording: He\u2019s untradeable\u2014for now. When the GOAT debate meets the salary cap, who blinks first?\n",

      "content_full": "\nModern football changed the role of fullbacks. Joao Cancelo does not get the ball at the touchline but instead close to the center of the penalty area, darting his head over his shoulder, like the tried and true No. 6. Just a moment after that, Achraf Hakimi takes off like a rocket down the right wing in a PSG shirt and pockets his way dwelling on the touchline. They are both fullbacks. Both do not play the position alike.\n\n\n\nThe fullback position in modern football has changed from a role functionally describing the wide defensive player into one of the most tactically challenging positions in football. The fullback used to be judged on stamina, overlapping runs, and crosses into the box, but a modern fullback must now be capable of thinking several phases of the game ahead of them\u2014as playmaker, press trigger, or all-purpose midfielder.\n\n\n\nFrom Touchline to Centre Circle\n\n\n\nTwenty years ago, fullbacks were mainly described as wide and athletic. Remember Cafu bombing down the flank on the right side of the field, Ashley Cole smothering attackers on the wide wings, or Roberto Carlos putting the thunderbolts with his long-range shooting? The plan was very straightforward: wide defending, overlapped winger, in the ball.\n\n\n\nThis was followed by the Guardiola effect. It was under Jupp Heynckes at Bayern Munich and subsequently at Manchester City that Philipp Lahm was converted into an inverted full-back, moving inside to become a midfielder when in possession. He was not a short-distance runner. He was a metronome of modern football.\n\n\n\nPhilipp Lahm and Pep Guardiola (Credits: GettyImages)\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need fast fullbacks,\u201d Guardiola once said. \u201cI need intelligent ones.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was a quiet revolution in football, and it changed everything.\n\n\n\nThe Inverted Full-Back\n\n\n\nThe inverted full-back is one of the more popular tactics to be utilized by elite clubs at the moment. These are the players that move to the center when the team has possession to aid in overloading midfield, maintaining shape during the transition, and recycling possession when defending.\n\n\n\nJoao Cancelo and Oleksandro Zinchenko are prototypes in modern football. Their heatmaps tend to resemble central midfielders compared to defenders. They assist their teams to take up a 3-2-5 formation in offense with a three-man backline anchored by two deep fullbacks/midfielders.\n\n\n\nOleksandro Zinchenko\u2019s Heat Map in Premier League 2024-25 (Credits: Sofascore)\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about recognizing the moment,\u201d Guardiola said of Cancelo in 2022. \u201cWhen to move inside, when to support the pivot, when to stay wide. He reads it perfectly.\u201d\n\n\n\nWidth, Press, and Chaos\n\n\n\nNot every fullback of modern football has, however, replaced chalk with central command. In the case of most teams, the conventional wide runner paradigm remains alive, especially in terms of counter-attacking and vertical tactics.\n\n\n\nAchraf Hakimi in PSG and Jeremie Frimpong in Bayer Leverkusen are ones who provide raw pace and attacking energy. They do not also attempt to dictate tempo but serve to drag out the opponent, get to the final third, and break defensive lines. In the same system, Frimpong, in Xabi Alonso, tends to be like a wing-back, although he is allowed in the box at times as an inverted forward with a defensive role.\n\n\n\nAnother instance would be Alphonso Davies at Bayern Munich. Bayern can transition by the mere speed and ability to dribble the ball that he possesses. They count high progressive carries and crosses per 90, despite having less injury time on the ball in the center of the park.\n\n\n\nThe variety is stark\u2014and deliberate.\n\n\n\nCheck out Alphonso Davies\u2019 stats\n\n\n\nOne Role, Many Layers\n\n\n\nThe emergence of hybrid fullbacks in modern football, the players who position differently in the middle of the game or as the tactics dictate, can be seen as the most interesting as well.\n\n\n\nAn example of such a trend in contemporary football is Trent Alexander-Arnold. A conventional right-back who used to do whipped crosses, he now routinely switches to the opposite side and plays as a deep-lying playmaker at Liverpool. He might even begin higher and drift inwards in the buildup when faced with less capable opposition.\n\n\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold at Liverpool (Credits: Getty Image)\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Theo Hernandez alternates between the traditional overlaps and the middle rushes, depending on how Milan plays. Ben White, an Arsenal player, hardly keeps overlap at all, but he also drops in as a 3rd center-back in the build-up, allowing Zinchenko to invert to the left.\n\n\n\nThis adaptability reflects a shift in coaching logic: fullbacks are no longer set in a mold\u2014they are tactical instruments, customized to fit a system.\n\n\n\nRising Stars\n\n\n\nThe future generation is already experiencing this complexity. All through Europe, fullbacks, and increasingly younger ones, are being coached not only to be quick or powerful but also intelligent on the field.\n\n\n\nMilos Kerkez (Liverpool/Hungary) has attacking instincts that are aggressive as well; however, he rebounds back rather fast in order to come back to the defensive line. His move to Liverpool would actually assist the Reds in filling in the gap left by Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\n\n\nMilos Kerkez after signing with Liverpool (Credits: Getty Images)\n\n\n\nTottenham\u2019s Destiny Udogie is a powerful player operating well in the inside channels, giving smart passing directions.\n\n\n\nDestiny Udogie of Tottenham Hotspurs (Credits: Getty Images)\n\n\n\nThe 20-year-old Rico Lewis (Manchester City) is already used as an inverted full-back, who often has to initiate attacks around his pivot.\n\n\n\nRico Lewis of Manchester City (Credit: Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\n\nThe Smartest Position in Modern Football?\n\n\n\nThe report from FBref stated that in the 2023-24 season, full-backs participated in the buildup to 38 percent of all goals in Europe\u2019s top leagues of five countries. The anticipated assist (xA) of full-back players such as Frimpong (0.22 xA/90) and Alexander-Arnold (0.30 xA/90) compares to that of creative midfielders.\n\n\n\nBut stats tell only part of the story.\n\n\n\nThe contemporary full-back needs to learn how to produce transitions, tempo, positional rotations, and one-on-one defense play in the process, sometimes in the same five-minute period. It is an office that calls for as much tactical sagacity as blistering speed in modern football.\n\n\n\n\u201cFull-backs are playmakers now,\u201d said Julian Nagelsmann last season. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re more important than your No. 10.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",

India will play a 5-T20I match series alongside a 3-match ODI series in an ODI World Cup year, but it will be quite helpful for them to understand the conditions and to adapt for the 2026 T20 World Cup, which England will host.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChance of Redemption for Indian Womens Seniors\n\n\n\nThe experienced all-rounder Sneh Rana is making a comeback after delivering terrific performances in the WPL and at the international level for India. Her inspiring comeback journey began in the WPL, where she made her debut for RCB and had a decent season. After that, Rana never looked back and always delivered when India needed.\n\n\n\nFor the flamboyant opener, Shafali Verma, this series will be most important because it is a transition phase for her from a teenage sensation to an experienced player. She will have to convert her strong start into an impactful and long innings. Verma has been performing well in domestic and international games; all she has to do in this series is to replicate the same form.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRadha Yadav is back in the squad in place of injured left-arm spin all-rounder Shuchi Upadhyay. It will be a significant chance for her to cement her position on the team. No doubt she\u2019s a terrific fielder and bowler. It\u2019s time for her to contribute in all aspects, especially with the bat. If she could do that and prove her mettle, then she would be an asset to the team.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEyes on the Indian young guns\n\n\n\nEveryone\u2019s eyes will be on the domestic star and an emerging pacer, Kranti Goud. She got her maiden call-up for India against South Africa. Young pacer has been a consistent performer for her domestic team, Madhya Pradesh. In the recent Senior Women\u2019s One Day Trophy, she clinched 15 wickets in 9 innings, including a 4-wicket haul in the final against Bengal. \n\n\n\nThis incredible performance helped her team rise victorious, and she won the POTM. Kranti did well in the WPL too, where she took a 4-wicket haul against the giants of the WPL (Delhi Capitals). If she continues to shine in this series as she did in the past, then she could be an integral part of the ODI and T20 World Cups.\n\n\n\nRicha Ghosh will look forward to making this series big. She cemented her position for a long time, and she did well. Richa has the highest strike rate on the Indian team, despite coming in at no.5 or no.6 sometimes. She tried to play till the end, but the lack of power hitting from the middle order stopped her. This WPL has performed exceptionally well for her. \n\n\n\nHow can you forget where she wreaked havoc against DC by scoring 69 runs in just 27 balls? This season, she played with a staggering strike rate of 175, but with the glove, she looked off. On this tour, Indian fans would be eager to see his lightning glove work with the ruthless batting.\u00a0\n\n\n\nN Shree Charani is one of the top young talents of India. She made her debut in the Tri series against SL & SA. In the WPL, she attacked batters with her pace by controlling the flow of her run-up. Charani played in the Senior Women\u2019s Multi-Day tournament, where she took 9 wickets in 3 games only. She became the first woman from the YSR district, Andhra Pradesh, to play for India. It is nothing but inspirational. If she is part of the playing XI, she can show the world why she is one of the top young talents for India.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIndia should change its brand of cricket in T20Is.\n\n\n\nLast year was full of heartbreak for the Indian women\u2019s team and the fans. They lost the final of the Asia Cup, where Athapaththu played the winning knock and clinched the title under the nose of the Indian team. After that, the group stage exit from the T20 WC 2024 was shocking. \n\n\n\nThey played average cricket; the fielding was poor, no support from the batting unit. If one wicket falls, the whole line-up crumbles. But that was the eye-opener for the team to improve the fielding and finally change the brand of cricket they play. The highest strike rate is 148 by Ghosh, which is acceptable, but others didn\u2019t even cross 135. If India wants to win the 2026 T20 World Cup, it should develop their style of batting. This series would be the perfect start for that, as England will be the hosts for the World Cup.\u00a0\n",

Reese alone grabbed nearly half of Chicago\u2019s total. She\u2019s been on a tear\u2014this was her third straight game with at least 15 boards. She now leads the WNBA in both total rebounds (13.1 per game) and offensive rebounds (5.1 per game). She\u2019s also the fastest player in league history to hit 150 rebounds and 50 assists in a season.\n\n\n\nAngel Reese has 3 straight 15+ REB games.That\u2019s tied for the longest streak in WNBA history. pic.twitter.com/QU2ASx8Ard\u2014 Real Sports (@realapp_) June 28, 2025 \n\n\n\nBut her dominance under the rim didn\u2019t swing the game Chicago\u2019s way. And that\u2019s the real story.\n\n\n\nReese Owned the Paint, But Sky Couldn\u2019t Finish\n\n\n\nDespite Reese\u2019s effort, the Sky only scored 8 second-chance points off their 8 offensive rebounds. In contrast, the Valkyries were missing key interior defenders due to international duty\u2014three starters were out. That gave Reese room to operate. She got position. She grabbed boards. But Chicago just didn\u2019t make the follow-up shots.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just poor luck. Chicago\u2019s finishing inside has been a concern all season. Even though they\u2019re among the league\u2019s better offensive rebounding teams (10.6 per game), they often fail to convert those extra chances into points.\n\n\n\nValkyries\u2019 Interior Issues Showed\u2014But Didn\u2019t Cost Them\n\n\n\nTough interior play and beating teams on the boards is the identity that Valkyries have developed. Friday night did not clearly show all that. Laeticia Amihere topped their rebound distribution without getting a starting line-up with 9 rebounds.\n\n\n\nValkyries\u2019 Kayla Thornton on her standout performance:\u201cIt just goes to my teammates. I play for them. I play for the city. I play for these wonderful fans out there that give us energy.\u201dThornton finished with a career-high 29 point on 8/15 FGs in a very physical game. pic.twitter.com/8l2Qk9HVJK\u2014 Kenzo Fukuda (@kenzofuku) June 28, 2025 \n\n\n\nand still their defense was commendable on occasion. The Valkyries keep the score Reese was racking relatively low. They clamped down in some critical situations and buried Chicago in the final minutes with a 12-0 run to overcome an endgame advantage by the Bulls.\n\n\n\nKayla Thornton topped the Golden State scoreboard with a career-high 29 points that included four three-point shots and some key late shot buckets.\n\n\n\nWhat Really Won the Game for Golden State\n\n\n\nThe Valkyries were outmatched in the paint, but they found other ways to win:\n\n\n\n\nFree throws: Golden State went 20-of-29 from the line. Chicago? Just 13-of-19.\n\n\n\nLate-game defense: They held Chicago scoreless in the final stretch.\n\n\n\nPerimeter shooting: Thornton and her teammates knocked down enough shots to keep pressure on the Sky.\n\n\n\n\nThat balance helped them overcome their weakened frontcourt and hold on for the win.\n\n\n\nReese\u2019s Rookie Season Is Already One for the Books\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget Reese is still a rookie. Her numbers are historic:\n\n\n\n\nAveraging a double-double through 13 games.\n\n\n\nMultiple double-doubles, including a streak of three straight with 15+ boards.\n\n\n\nA consistent presence in big moments\u2014even in losses.\n\n\n\n\nHer performance in this game may not have led to a win, but it reinforced her value and exposed a weakness in a Valkyries team that usually prides itself on interior toughness.\n\n\n\nQuote of the Night\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo team should out-rebound us, given our identity,\u201d said Kayla Thornton postgame. \u201cWe should be imposing that on other teams every night\u2026 Now, we need to ground ourselves and get back to work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a message that suggests Golden State knows they were lucky to escape with the win\u2014and that Reese\u2019s impact didn\u2019t go unnoticed.\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nAngel Reese did her job. She controlled the boards, gave Chicago second chances, and kept the Sky in the game.\n\n\n\nBut basketball isn\u2019t just about rebounding. Without clean finishes, second-chance points don\u2019t mean much. And on a night where the Valkyries were short-handed in the paint, it should have mattered more.\n\n\n\nInstead, it was a reminder: dominance on the glass is only one part of the game. The other part? Turning effort into results.\n\n\n\nKey Stats \u2013 Valkyries vs. Sky (June 28, 2025)\n\n\n\nCategoryChicago SkyValkyriesFinal Score7883Total Rebounds4242Offensive Rebounds8(not listed)Second-Chance Points8(not listed)Leading RebounderReese (18)Amihere (9)Leading ScorerAtkins (20)Thornton (29)3-Point Shooting13-33 (39%)13-30 (43%)Free Throws13-1920-29\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nOn June 27 th the Indiana Fever entered Gainbridge Fieldhouse with playoff hope flickering, buoyed by a streak of alternating wins and losses that had left them just below the .500 mark. The flailing Los Angeles Sparks appeared to be in need of taking. However, since it happened during three quarters of tough, hard-nosed basketball, and a strong third quarter especially, it was the game-ending collapse by Indiana in the fourth quarter that shocked the fans, and may end up scarred onto their post season goals.\n\n\n\nAn encouraging Trigger Turns Sour\n\n\n\nThe third-quarter showing by Indiana was electric. Out of the 33 points they had in the first half, the Fever went off in the third, scoring 24 and taking advantage of turnovers and mid-range and beyond rhythm. The scoring output of Kelsey Mitchell was coupled with the interior presence of Aliyah Boston and a late run by Aari McDonald that enabled the Fever to establish a manageable lead. The atmosphere in the home crowd could experience the tipping point.\n\n\n\nThe Hoosiers went into the last 10 minutes of play just looking to end their recent streak of inconsistency and give themselves a much-needed win. Rather, the fourth quarter was a lesson on how opportunity, defense, and mind slip-ups should not be done. The Fever lost the final quarter 35-17 as they collapsed to enable Los Angeles reverse the game script and stroll to a dramatic 85-75 victory.\n\n\n\nA Pattern the Fever Can\u2019t Shake\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the Fever have faltered late. Over the past five games, they\u2019ve shown flashes of playoff-caliber basketball\u2014most notably in wins against the Liberty and Sun\u2014but have also suffered collapses against Seattle, Vegas, and now L.A. What\u2019s especially concerning is the timing and manner of these losses.\n\n\n\nAzura Stevens and Kelsey Plum lead the Sparks to a win over the Fever \ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/aLFOdW7rPv\u2014 espnW (@espnW) June 27, 2025 \n\n\n\nIn this game, the Fever allowed Kelsey Plum and Azur\u00e1 Stevens to control the pace in the fourth quarter. Stevens, who finished with a game-high 23 points, found her groove inside and out, while Plum orchestrated the Sparks\u2019 offense with poise, notching 6 assists to go with her 21 points. The Sparks shot 50% from the field overall\u2014punishing Indiana\u2019s lack of fourth-quarter defensive discipline.\n\n\n\nIndiana, by contrast, hit just 37% from the floor, including a dismal 25% from three. Despite solid efforts from Mitchell (20 pts) and Boston (12 pts, 10 reb), the Fever simply could not keep up in the final quarter\u2014turning the ball over 13 times to L.A.\u2019s 19, but with far more damaging timing.\n\n\n\nThe Psychological Toll of Blown Leads\n\n\n\nGiving up a double-figure lead in the last quarter is not only a red warning sign, it is an emotional punch in the heart. The Fever held this game almost 25 minutes, and when they came to face pressure, they seemed to have become paralyzed. There was a great lack of veteran leadership and composure.\n\n\n\nWhat is more alarming is that such kind of loss may destroy the confidence of a young team. The emerging stars in the Fever center in the persons of Boston and Mitchell but they lack a go to closer or a coherent halfcourt identity, and so, they are a club with tiny margins of errors.\n\n\n\nPlayoff Implications\n\n\n\nWith a 7\u20138 record and a crowded middle tier in the WNBA standings, every win matters. The Fever sit just below the playoff cutline and now face two more tough matchups\u2014against Dallas and Minnesota\u2014in the space of five days. Dropping a home game to a 4\u201311 Sparks squad not only hurts their seeding hopes but raises uncomfortable questions about their ability to execute under pressure.\n\n\n\nTheir upcoming schedule doesn\u2019t offer much relief. Minnesota is surging, and Dallas\u2014though inconsistent\u2014can match Indiana\u2019s pace and exploit transition vulnerabilities. If the Fever can\u2019t regroup quickly, this loss could signal the beginning of a dangerous slide.\n\n\n\nWhat Needs to Change?\n\n\n\nIt is true that Indiana has a talented squad. Boston is an elite prospect in the conception. Mitchell is dangerous in time. However, it is not just about talent, the Fever does require some consistency and this starts with the supporting cast.\n\n\n\nThe coaching crew will be required to work with defense rotations and end game decision making. More to the point, they should create the culture in which leads are not disrespected and mental toughness be as crucial as a shooting percentage.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nTo a team that is crawling its way into the post season the fourth against L.A. was more than just another bad quarter, it was a missed chance, and likely a turning point. In the event the Colts do not qualify into the playoffs, what would be a sore side is remembering this night in Indianapolis as the one that they could not get to.\n\n\n\nAnd in such a competitive league it takes much longer than 10 minutes sometimes to get rid of the memories of lost opportunities as ghosts.\n",

      "content_full": "\nCricket is a strategic, skill-based team game. Although the brilliance of a specific person can sometimes tip the scale in favor, the presence of the captain in this case is vital in ensuring that the team gets the win. The right captain will be able to inspire, motivate, and lead his team to victory whereas the wrong captain will cause confusion, demotivation and defeat. This article describes what captaincy is all about in cricket, what makes a good captain, challenges of being a captain and the effects of captaincy on team performance.\n\n\n\nThe key qualities of a good caption\n\n\n\nThere is no specific set of skills, traits, and qualities that a good captain in cricket should have, and a combination of these aspects allows successful management of his team. Some of the major traits of a good captain entail\n\n\n\n\nLeadership skills: A quality captain must know how to encourage and motivate his or her people to do the best they can. This requires the development of healthy team culture, trust and the development of team spirit within the players.\n\n\n\nDecision-making skills: As a captain, one will have to come up with fast decisions and be well informed as this can affect the game. It means a thorough knowledge of the game, its specifics and the strong and weak sides of their team.\n\n\n\nTactical sense: A fine captain must have the ability to read the game, predict what the opposition will do, and counter the move. This includes laying smart fields, turning around the strike and effective use of blowers.\n\n\n\nCommunication skills: As a captain, he or she must know how to interact with others and also offer feedback, directions and encouragement to the team members.\n\n\n\nEmotional intelligence: A captain must be capable of controlling his or her emotions, performance and that of his or her crew.\n\n\n\n\nThe Challenges of Captaincy:\n\n\n\nAll is not smooth sailing with captaincy. A captain must find a compromise between the interests of a single athlete and the team, be willing to make hard choices in a tight situation, and be assertive to new twists and turns. They should also be able to take charge of themselves in terms of emotions and performance and their team as well. Popular issues that captains encounter are:\n\n\n\n\nPressure to perform: The captain feels the pressure to perform and bring his/her team to victory. This may be hectic and also affect the decision-making and leadership of these people.\n\n\n\nHaving the ego to control: A captain must be able to control the ego of his or her players, especially the senior ones who are opinionated and in possession of distinct personalities\n\n\n\nIncorporation of difficult situations: A captain must have to make tough choices, which will include the choice of players, pitch fields and declarations of innings.\n\n\n\n\nThe Impact of Captaincy on Team Performance:\n\n\n\nThe impact of captaincy on team performance cannot be overstated. A good captain can inspire their team to perform beyond their potential, while poor captains can lead to underperformance. Captaincy can also influence team culture, player morale and overall team dynamics. Some of the ways in which captaincy can impact team performance include\n\n\n\n\nTeam Culture: A captain can shape the team culture, including the values, norms, and behavior of the team.\n\n\n\nPlayer Morale: A captain can impact player morale, including their motivation, confidence, and job satisfaction\n\n\n\nTeam dynamics: A captain can influence team dynamics, including communication and conflict resolution.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Words\n\n\n\nBeing a cricket captain is not just about field knowledge and bowling changes, it is all about leadership, tactical understanding, and human emotions and egos in the competitive team scenario. A captain is the pillar of the team and determines the team environment on and off the pitch. \n\n\n\nCaptaincy requires the ability to have those qualities that can help in winning matches and are fundamentally required in cricket. A captain should be able to bring people together and take crucial decisions when required, and it is imperative to make changes as the match progresses. Finally, a good captain would prove to be what makes a good team great.\n",

      "content_full": "\nCricket, which is supposed to be a gentleman\u2019s game, has never been just a sport. It is the reflection of culture, temperament, and even time. This is more evident nowhere than in the two cricketing giants: India and England. One lives on the mania of the floodlights and fireworks; the other revels in patience in a poem. Sixes excite one, and maiden overs cheer up the other. One has fallen head over heels in love with T20; the other continues with a love affair with the long, drawn-out rhythms of Test cricket.\n\n\n\nIt is not only an over/format divide. It is a story of two cricketing cultures unfolding along a similar line but under different influences of history, economy, and emotion.\n\n\n\nThe Birth of T20 and the Indian Revolution\n\n\n\nGo back to 2007. India had recently lost the ODI World Cup in the Caribbean. The country was devastated. However, then people say a rope was hung and wrapped around 20 overs: India, the surprise of the T20 World Cup in South Africa, the first ICC event ever held. It had no older players in it and a young MS Dhoni, under whom a team of young players played a spirited match to win. In one night India had fallen in love with T20.\n\n\n\nThe Indian Premier League (IPL), which opened its doors in 2008, did not only ride on this wave; it caused a tsunami. Full stadiums, Bollywood owners of teams, international celebrities, cheerleaders, and drama in an instant made IPL look like more than a sport; it was prime-time entertainment.\n\n\n\nWith an average age of less than 30 years and a population of 1.4 billion, the youthful hankering after speed, spectacle, and success only found expression in T20 cricket. You work all day; you don\u2019t have time to watch cricket. Just give me fast, exciting cricket, says 24-year-old marketing executive Rohit Nair in Mumbai. T20 is a lot like sitting down and watching an entire season of Netflix in three hours.\n\n\n\nWhy India Bats for T20?\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s T20 obsession is deeply entwined with its societal rhythms. Cities are crowded. Attention spans are shrinking. Mobile screens dominate leisure time. T20 fits this frame like a glove.Every six hits bring the crowd to its feet. Every over is a mini-battle. All of the drama, glory, heartache, and ecstasy that India grew up watching in movies is now being acted out on a cricket field in just three hours.Additionally, the IPL accomplished what Test cricket was never able to do: make domestic players famous. From Jasprit Bumrah to Rinku Singh, T20 has democratized fame.Economically too, T20 is a juggernaut. India\u2019s sports broadcasting deals, sponsorships, and merchandise sales are largely IPL-driven. Advertisers, constantly chasing eyeballs, pour millions into the format. The BCCI earns more from one IPL season than from several years of bilateral Test series.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no comparison,\u201d says sports economist Dr. Veena Raghavan. \u201cFor India, T20 isn\u2019t just a format it\u2019s a full-blown economy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe UK\u2019s Enduring Love Affair with Test Cricket\n\n\n\nIn England, the birthplace of cricket, Test matches are still revered like classical symphonies. At Lord\u2019s, The Oval, Headingley, or Edgbaston, whites are worn with pride, and clouds overhead are analyzed like battle conditions. Sessions are slow-cooked, strategies unravel over days, and character rather than charisma wins games.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s chess, not checkers,\u201d says Henry Thompson, a 58-year-old MCC member from Sussex. \u201cAnyone can slog in T20. But can you face James Anderson under gloomy skies with the ball swinging both ways? That\u2019s cricket.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTest cricket in England isn\u2019t just about nostalgia; it\u2019s about tradition. Afternoon teas, slow claps, polite applause for defensive shots\u2014this is cricket as the British knew and loved it for centuries. It is also what they exported to the colonies.Even in 2023, the Ashes remain a television and cultural event. When England plays Australia, work slows down, pubs fill up, and the country tunes in.There\u2019s something inherently British about Test cricket\u2019s aesthetics. It values grit over glamour. A batter scoring 50 runs in four hours while dodging bouncers and breaking a sweat is celebrated more than a 25-ball fifty in a T20. Test cricket rewards endurance, planning, and poise.It also reflects a societal tempo. British summers are long and measured. There\u2019s room for rain delays, for long lunches, and for commentary laced with dry humor. Test matches allow life to meander.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just watch a Test match,\u201d says BBC commentator Alison Mitchell. \u201cYou live with it for five days. It\u2019s like reading a great novel, each chapter bringing a twist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEven with the rise of England\u2019s own domestic T20 leagues, Test cricket remains the gold standard for legacy, especially under the recent Bazball era\u2014an aggressive, entertaining take on the longest format, championed by Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum.\n\n\n\nThe Generational Chasm\n\n\n\nIn India, children are more likely to grow up idolizing Virat Kohli\u2019s IPL heroics or Surya Kumar Yadav\u2019s scoops than Rahul Dravid\u2019s stoic 180 at Eden Gardens. Test cricket feels like an antique\u2014respected but rarely used.In England, while T20 has certainly grown in popularity, many young fans are still introduced to cricket through backyard Test-style play, county matches, and stories of Ashes legends.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reverence for Test cricket passed down in families,\u201d says cricket writer George Dobell. \u201cIn India, it\u2019s almost reversed\u2014T20 is the generational glue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe Broadcast Battle\n\n\n\nAnother big factor is access and storytelling. In India, T20 matches are broadcast in multiple languages across apps, websites, and even cinemas. Commentary is spicy, graphics are explosive, and social media reels are instant.Test cricket, on the other hand, requires a different kind of commitment\u2014both in viewing and in marketing. It doesn\u2019t always translate well to the Instagram generation.In England, broadcasters like Sky Sports and BBC have managed to maintain Test cricket\u2019s prestige with documentary-style coverage, deep analysis, and rich storytelling. \u201cThey sell the soul of the game, not just its highlights,\u201d notes Dr. Raghavan.\n\n\n\nCan the Two Worlds Meet?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think of this as a battle\u2014T20 vs. Test, modern vs. traditional, East vs. West. But the truth is more nuanced.Many Indian fans still cherish iconic Test moments: VVS Laxman\u2019s 281, the Gabba win in 2021, or Bumrah\u2019s spells in England. Similarly, English crowds do turn up in droves for T20 games and The Hundred.What\u2019s different is the primary cricketing identity. For India, T20 is the present and future\u2014Test cricket is prestige, but not priority. For England, Test cricket is still the soul\u2014T20 is fun, but not folklore. Perhaps the divide isn\u2019t as much cultural as it is emotional.\n\n\n\nYou may like:\n\n\n\n\nWhat Went Wrong for India After a Record-Breaking Start?\n\n\n\nVirat Kohli, India\u2019s Batting Maestro, Bows Out of Test Cricket\n\n\n\nNBA Draft 2025 Preview: Key Dates, Top Prospects, Venues, and What to Expect\n\n\n\nWatch: Messi\u2019s Pinpoint Assist Sets Up Inter Miami\u2019s Opener\n\n\n\n\nCan Test cricket survive in India? Can T20 become more than a carnival in England?\n\n\n\nSome solutions are emerging. India\u2019s WTC (World Test Championship) success has sparked renewed interest. Day-night tests with pink balls are drawing new viewers. In England, the ECB is investing in more community T20s to engage younger audiences.And maybe that\u2019s the balance let each format play its part.Test cricket can remain the canvas for artistry and grit. T20 can be the pop concert, drawing the crowds. ODI cricket may find its place as the forgotten middle child. But as long as bat meets ball and the spirit remains, cricket will adapt.In the End, It\u2019s Still Cricket. Cricket\u2019s beauty lies in its diversity. A farmer in Punjab and a banker in London can both fall in love with the same game for completely different reasons.In India, T20 is life lived at 200 beats per minute. In England, Test cricket is a timeless sonnet, unfolding verse by verse. And maybe that\u2019s not a divide. Maybe it\u2019s harmony just in different keys.\n",

      "content_full": "\nIn the 148-year history of the game, it is the first time a team has ended up on the losing side despite scoring five centuries. After 4 days of berserk batting by both teams, the last day is expected to be a balanced fight between bat and ball. As always, England\u2019s openers played in a sizzling manner and won the match by 5 wickets. Now, they will be heading to Birmingham with a lead of 1-0.\n\n\n\nTest of character, failed: India\u2019s first big step in transition, and they fall. \n\n\n\nAfter winning the toss, Stokes chose to bowl, and when Ravi asked Gill about that decision, he said we would do the same. Indian openers came to bat and did what was expected; they looked unflustered till the time they batted. Rahul and Jaiswal set the stage for the upcoming batters; the captain and the vice-captain scored centuries alongside Jaiswal.\n\n\n\nAccording to Cricbuzz, India was 430-4, then suddenly, under 41 runs, they lost 7 wickets and repeated the same mistake in the 2nd innings, losing 6 wickets under 31 runs. \n\n\n\nIn the post-match conference, the Indian coach Gambhir addressed\n\n\n\n\nThese things happen. Even proper batters fail. Hopefully they\u2019ll learn, and hopefully we\u2019ll get better performances from our tail. And that is not the only reason we lost the Test Match.\n\n\n\n\nOn the contrary, with the last line, tail-enders not scoring cannot be the sole reason, but it is one of the major reasons for a team to lose the match. If you look at England\u2019s lower order, they scored more than 100 runs combined in both innings. Our lower order didn\u2019t stay at the crease for long enough to contribute something; they all just threw their wickets and surrendered in front of England\u2019s average bowling line-up.\n\n\n\nThe carry job is still there in Indian cricket.\n\n\n\nDecades passed, the team went through several transitions, and great players came and went, but one thing remains the same throughout the history of Indian Cricket is one man carrying the team. In the 90s and 2000s, Sachin did that, in the 2010s, Kohli was the man, and currently, Bumrah is doing that thankless job. Even after the series losses in the Test format, the coaching team does not appear to learn from their errors. \n\n\n\nJasprit Bumrah conversation with Shubman Gill \nCredit: Getty Images\n\n\n\nIf Bumrah gets wickets, you are happy and blessed that he represents the Indian team, and when he does not get any, you wonder, why do we have one Bumrah? Here in this game, there was never a moment when you could say that there was enough backup for him. Fielders dropped catches and could not stop the boundaries, the biggest reason behind India\u2019s defeat. It is true that bowlers win you tournaments and series, but not one. You need a proper bowling unit, where they support each other from both ends.\n\n\n\nHistoric individual performances, but failed as a team.\n\n\n\nThis game began with the high note of India as Jaiswal and Rahul provided a good base, played as per the condition, and they did an excellent job in grasping the ball. It aids the future batters to be able to score. The three Indian Test Cricket of the future (Jaiswal, Gill & Pant) began the down pour of centuries. \n\n\n\nJaiswal is also showing his powers and abilities of hitting the centuries in his first tour to the SENA countries. The captain subsequently scored his maiden away test century and shut the pundits up. He scored the perfect 147 runs and thereby he was the 5th Indian captain to make 100 on the first game occasion.\n\n\n\nHe gripped one end, and played lovely orthodox shots. We cannot call him by the name of Prince without a reason because his batting style and method of scoring runs are quite like Kohli in the white ball. He can actually take his legacy into the white ball, but in the red ball, he has to do justice to his talent, skills, or potential yet. The vice-captain came after the captain and went down in the history by helping himself to two centuries in each innings of the event.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea8 FIRST TIME IN 148 YEARS \ud83d\udea8India becomes the first team in Test cricket history to lose a match after having 5 individual centuries. \ud83e\udd2fHistory made\u2026 for all the wrong reasons.#ENGvsIND #TestCricket #CricketStats #INDvsENG pic.twitter.com/wVbbSTmidU\u2014 Choudhary kapil (@Kapilmalik3011) June 24, 2025 \n\n\n\nHe became the 7th Indian to do so and the only 2nd WK batter in the history of the game to achieve this feat. His first-inning century was unlike his style, but he made sure to score the 2nd one in a Pant-astic manner. He was constantly talking to himself and trying not to play a big shot, and because of this, India went from 92-3 to 364. These knocks perfectly reflect his maturity, game awareness, and hunger. If someone asks why he\u2019ll be one of the greatest to play this format, show them these centuries.\n\n\n\nCredit: Getty Images\n\n\n\nNow, the two most senior players of the team, Jasprit Bumrah and KL Rahul, both proved that experience matters the most in away tours. KL Rahul looked beautiful while batting in the first innings, but a loose shot and he had to go back. But he made a stronger comeback in the 2nd inning. Jaiswal was gone, Gill was gone, and Rahul stood there and ran. \n\n\n\nHe made a partnership with Sai, Pant, and Karun and communicated with them in three different languages. His innings was as crucial as Pant\u2019s; they did provide a stage for lower-order batters, but they did nothing.\n\n\n\nWhen One Man Carries a Nation\u2019s Bowling Hopes\n\n\n\nThe last and the backbone of Indian Cricket Team is Jasprit Bumrah and what to say you just can not stop talking about him. He is a mystery; you cannot merely explain what he had accomplished and what had been the modus operandi, but you exactly feel that whatever that he had accomplished is not more but a wonderful thing. It happened like when Bumrah got wickets in the first innings, India was in a position where they can bowled out England out but when he did not do a terrific job in the second innings, the bowling line failed.\n\n\n\nThe opposite foresight was able to predict which ball will come. This bowling attack does not see the presence of Bumrah and this fact is not helping this bowling team to give enough confidence that it will be able to win at least one of the games in this series.\n\n\n\nAs they have lost the last match, India would need to restructure their playing eleven which includes some important decisions and focus on fielding to win the next match. This will also be the greatest challenge to this budding Indian team; transitioning out of an era is not an easy task. But the decision of the side and certain attitude of the coaching staff could help to remove at least some thorns on the way.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nBasketball fans, save your calendars! The next NBA draft, 2025 has the potential to not only bring new talent but also restore hope to teams entering the NBA. It is one of the most awaited events where potential college players and players abroad are allowed to begin their careers as professionals after being picked strategically in a scheduled order by individual teams.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the draft is arguably the most important way through which the NBA injects fresh talent into the league. Just think of a pageant-like event where professional teams compete against each other to get the brightest young talent in their collegiate programs and overseas circuits.\n\n\n\nThe order of selections is carefully designed so as to achieve a competitive balance: normally, the teams with the less successful records of the previous season are awarded earlier ones. The infamous goal of this system, well-illustrated by the so-called Draft Lottery of the most favorable picks in it, is to give the less successful teams a more realistic opportunity to get game-changing players and, therefore, to even the score.\n\n\n\nIt is a vital part of the NBA format that does not allow one or two clubs to dominate forever and keeps the league fun and interesting year after season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Two-Night Extravaganza: Venue, Dates, and a funny twist\n\n\n\nThe NBA Draft of 2025 undoubtedly will be one to remember, with its two nights of action beginning on Thursday, June 26th, 2025 in India to start with the first round, and on Thursday, June 27th, 2025 to complete the selection process with the second round. The two evenings will occur at the legendary Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, which is a lively place and one that has the capacity to accommodate mega sports events.\n\n\n\nFun Fact: Although most NBA Drafts include an ascending number of 60 players, the 2025 one will have only 59. This margin loss can be attributed to a lost second-round selection by the New York Knicks as a result of a violation of a rule in the past before this happened. It is a case that is unique to this draft and not rather common.\n\n\n\nTop Prospects to Watch\n\n\n\n1. Cooper Flagg (Forward, Duke): \n\n\n\nLong believed to be a shoo-in as the undisputed No. 1 prospect this year, Flagg is the most likely to be drafted first overall. All this leads to a rather well-rounded game player, with high-end defensive instincts, a surprisingly smooth offensive skill set and an extremely high basketball IQ relative to his age. In an own-goal sort of twist, the Dallas Mavericks won the Draft Lottery and now enjoy the No. 1 pick in the draft, and there is virtually no chance that they will not pick Flagg as one of their franchise players.\n\n\n\nNEWS: Ahead of Wednesday's NBA Draft, the state of Maine is declaring June 25, 2025 \"Flagg Day.\"Duke star Cooper Flagg, a Maine native, is expected to be selected No. 1 overall. pic.twitter.com/zQ3Q39ogkm\u2014 The Athletic (@TheAthletic) June 25, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI happen to think he is the best freshman player that Duke has ever had.\u201d \u2013 NBA Analyst Jay Bilas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Dylan Harper (Guard, Rutgers): \n\n\n\nHarper is sniping at Flagg right behind him, being pegged as No. 2 overall in almost everything. He is an extremely efficient defender who can score and assist others as he has unique playmaking skills. The San Antonio Spurs who have a tendency of nurturing talents, are in the second position to make their choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHarper is so good in pick-and-roll situations, getting into the lane and creating for himself. He\u2019s strong, has a great court sense. I happen to feel he\u2019s going to have a great NBA career as long as he stays healthy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n3. VJ Edgecombe (Guard, Baylor): \n\n\n\nHe is an explosive and agile athlete who has steadily gained favor on mock draft boards. His athleticism and emerging skill levels as an offensive player offer him a high scoring spot in the top 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI just love playing basketball. I had a coach who helped me out, too. I just love competing.\u201d \u2013 VJ Edgecombe\n\n\n\n\n4. Tre Johnson (Guard, Texas): \n\n\n\nA talented offensive player who can be dangerous in the NBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do what others won\u2019t; I\u2019m going to play defense, that\u2019s one way, and just watch film to see how I can be different from other players and find different ways to help the team win.\u201d \u2013 Tre Johnson\n\n\n\n\n5. Ace Bailey (Forward, Rutgers): \n\n\n\nA scorer who is strong on his feet, has plenty of athleticism and can become a two-way player.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do my best to get us what we need. That NBA Championship and a lot more coming.\u201d \u2013 Ace Bailey\n\n\n\n\n6. Kon Knueppel (Forward, Duke): \n\n\n\nYet another heavily hyped Duke player, with a strong set of skills to match, is a forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust get into the gym. Consistency is definitely key. I started to get into the gym a lot when I was in middle school and started to fall in love with basketball that way.\u201d \u2013 Kon Knueppel\n\n\n\n\n7. Hugo Gonzalez (Guard, Real Madrid\u2014International): \n\n\n\nThe next international name whose talents are unique and can actually make him a lottery pick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look fazed by the moment but rather energized when his team needs him.\u201d \u2013 Basketball scout\n\n\n\n\n8. Darryn Peterson (Guard, Undecided \u2013 High School): \n\n\n\nA high school player at the top of the country, he has amazing potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are only some of the numerous enthralling players who will have their names come up during draft night, each of them wanting to leave an imprint in the NBA.\n\n\n\nWhere to watch the 2025 draft\n\n\n\nYou can tune-in to watch the 2025 draft on the official website of ESPN Sports: https://www.espn.in\n\n\n\nTimings\u2014Round 1: 26th June \u2013 5:30 a.m. ISTRound 2: 27th June \u2013 5:30 a.m. IST\n\n\n\n\n",

Although Bayern Munich had already qualified and assured their place in the knockout stage, the defeat was a grim reminder that, football being football, even the largest outfit could be caught napping. An early strike, an excellent display of goalkeeping, and a bit of VAR drama turned out to be the undoing of a rotated Bayern lineup.\n\n\n\nBayern Munich manager Vincent Kompany said during the post-match presentation:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think our first half wasn\u2019t good at all. With the pitch and the heat, I just feared this wouldn\u2019t go as fluid as normal,\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFINAL. BENFICA 1-0 BAYERN MUNICH.BOCA JUNIORS QUEDA ELIMINADO DEL MUNDIAL DE CLUBES, SIN IMPORTAR SU RESULTADO VS AUCKLAND CITY. pic.twitter.com/FmuasAuj95\u2014 Tomiconcina (@Tomiconcina) June 24, 2025 \n\n\n\nBenfica Strikes Early\n\n\n\nThe German football giants had a bolt start in the match. Only 13 minutes into the match, Andreas Schjelderup made it into the back of the net on behalf of Benfica off a properly struck cross performed by Fredrik Aursnes. It was the first impression, as Bayern, despite the endless possession tempo, appeared awkwardly divided in the first half. \n\n\n\nManager Vincent Kompany who made seven changes to his starting eleven, potentially in order to give some resting time to his most important players before the upcoming Club World Cup games, appeared to have shot himself in the foot as the team made sluggish starts and could not really create any good scoring chances.\n\n\n\nEven the famous goalkeeper Manuel Neuer acknowledged the fact that the team was not very intense and focused during the first period. Bayern became stronger as the second half rolled in.With high-profile player Harry Kane, Joshua Kimmich, and Michael Olise replacing them at the half, there was some backbone and impetus put behind Kane and Joshua Kimmich.\n\n\n\nThe pressure got to Benfica, yet their defense held against a splendid effort on the part of goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin, who put in an extraordinary showing that was truly an exceptional way to maintain teams and resist.\n\n\n\nTHE WINNING MOMENT Credits \u2013 DAZN \n\n\n\nTrubin the saviour\n\n\n\nTrubin was already writing the history of that night, and with a number of fabulous saves he kept the players and spectators of Bayern motionless. He made two incredible saves on two occasions having gone one on one with Leroy Sane who would have easily pulled his German team into it.\n\n\n\nHe then repelled another shot by Thomas Muller with massive responses and even held off a short ranged rocket by Aleksandar Pavlovic off his leg. It was a keeping workshop, a keeping masterclass, which gave him professional credits as he was made position- Man of the Match by the two sides.\n\n\n\nTRUBIN THE SAVIOUR\n\n\n\nLuck Not Favoring Bayern\n\n\n\nWhat made the Bayern even more nervous was that the offside goal was not scored in the 61st minute but the court created the huge controversy among the fans. Joshua Kimmich took a strong shot and made the ball enter the net, however, the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) intervened. \n\n\n\nIt was revealed on replay that it is offside by Harry Kane and this can be taken to mean that this is the person who makes Trubin blind. Such appeal to the argument highlighted the unfortunate night of Bayern die Losers who made an attempt to crack the defensive line but could not succeed it eventually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayern\u2019s Frustration: Missed Chances and a Bitter Lesson Learned\n\n\n\nThe second part was marked by Bayern trying everything to achieve the equalizer in vain as the team failed, although this period was filled with missed chances. Harry Kane, normally so ruthless, headed a cross from a late corner wide, an unusual experience for Bayern Munich fans. \n\n\n\nA weak start, a reshuffled team tussling with unity, and an inspired performance in goal by Benfica proved to be their demise. Although this defeat will not completely jeopardize their goals at the FIFA Club World Cup, it should be a good lesson for the Bayern tactical approach during the home legs of the knockout games at this prestigious international club football competition.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnyway, we were dominant, we created more chances, and we didn\u2019t win. We can\u2019t afford for this to happen but we still take momentum into the next game.\u201d \u2013 said Bayern Munchen Manager Vincent Kompany in the Post-match Presentation\n\n\n\n\nTHE LOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT\n\n\n\nWatch the Full Match Highlights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead about more interesting football news.\n\n\n\n\nWatch: Messi\u2019s Pinpoint Assist Sets Up Inter Miami\u2019s Opener\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content_full": "\nInter Miami and Palmeiras fought out a 2-2 draw to dramatic conclusion in the final Group A match of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 which had the tension of a knockout round and the vibe of a final. Although the scoreline guarantees both teams will get to the next round, the game will be remembered thanks to one of the greatest players of all time (Messi) who was not officially credited with the assist but did help spark the first goal.\n\n\n\nThis was not the usual football game on the other but a very serious one, as it was played at America with more than 60,000 fans present at the full Hard Rock Stadium. To Inter Miami, it was a chance to stamp authority in their very first FIFA Club World Cup edition. Palmeiras would face a character test against a team that was trying to be built around two icons of football Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.\n\n\n\nA Goal That Began With Genius\n\n\n\nThe opening goal in the 16th minute was a showcase of Inter Miami\u2019s tactical transition \u2014 and more so, Messi\u2019s footballing IQ. Dropping into midfield, Messi collected the ball near the halfway line and, with minimal space, delivered a subtle but deadly vertical pass between two Palmeiras midfielders. The move instantly shifted the momentum of the play.\n\n\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez received the ball, shielding it brilliantly before flicking it into the path of Tadeo Allende. Allende\u2019s finish \u2014 a composed right-footed shot low into the corner \u2014 was clean, but it was Messi\u2019s initial involvement that dismantled Palmeiras\u2019 structure.\n\n\n\nThough official records gave Su\u00e1rez the assist, analysts and fans alike were quick to praise Messi\u2019s role in orchestrating the goal. It was a textbook example of a \u201cpre-assist\u201d \u2014 the kind of pass that rarely makes headlines but often defines games.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt all started with Messi. The vision to break lines, the timing \u2014 you just can\u2019t teach that,\u201d said Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano in the post-match press conference.\n\n\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez Strikes Again\n\n\n\nAfter a measured and disciplined first half, Inter Miami doubled their advantage in the 65th minute. This time, there was no debate about the scorer. Luis Su\u00e1rez, showing signs of his old self, pounced on a loose ball just inside the area. With a quick shift to his left foot, he rifled a shot into the top left corner. Palmeiras goalkeeper Marcelo Lomba was left rooted as the Uruguayan celebrated with arms outstretched.\n\n\n\nIt was a reward not only for Su\u00e1rez\u2019s persistence but also for the balance Inter Miami had shown up to that point \u2014 maintaining over 50% possession, creating higher-quality chances, and executing transitions with precision.\n\n\n\nPalmeiras\u2019 Late Surge\n\n\n\nYet in football, control means little without concentration, especially against a club with Palmeiras\u2019 pedigree. Despite being second-best for much of the night, the Brazilian giants showed why they remain one of South America\u2019s elite.\n\n\n\nIn the 80th minute, Allan\u2019s well-weighted through ball found Paulinho in the left channel. The forward cut inside and unleashed a low shot past \u00d3scar Ustari. It was the first real lapse in Miami\u2019s back line \u2014 and it proved costly.\n\n\n\nSeven minutes later, a loose clearance invited pressure again. Palmeiras\u2019 Maur\u00edcio, who had been quiet until that point, picked up the ball at the edge of the box and curled in a sublime finish to level the score at 2\u20132. In the blink of an eye, Inter Miami\u2019s two-goal cushion had evaporated.\n\n\n\nMessi\u2019s Visible Disappointment\n\n\n\nAt the whistle, Lionel Messi, who had been key to this point, got off the field head down, lip pursed. The cameras have caught on him walking directly down the tunnel, without going through the customary hand shake line. Members of the team subsequently confirmed that his anger was not only down to the score-line, but also due to what he reportedly saw as a lack of control in the last 10 minutes of the game.\n\n\n\nMore than 20 years of magic. Another year of Messi.Lionel Andr\u00e9s Messi turns 38 today. \ud83c\udf82\u2728#FIFACWC | #FIFAWorldCup pic.twitter.com/6LkMZUAWl0\u2014 FIFA World Cup (@FIFAWorldCup) June 24, 2025 \n\n\n\nand you can easily see his exasperation. It was under the control of Inter Miami. The victory would have seen them emerge the group leaders and would not face an uphill task in the quarter finals. Rather, the lottery result translates into a rematch with who other than Paris St. Germain \u2013 the former club of the striker and one of the favorites of the tournament.\n\n\n\nThe Bigger Picture: Tactics, Trends, and Turnarounds\n\n\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint, this match was a tale of two halves. Inter Miami dominated the central channels in the first 45 minutes. Sergio Busquets and Federico Redondo controlled the tempo, often feeding Messi, who operated in a free role behind Su\u00e1rez. The front pairing\u2019s chemistry was undeniable \u2014 a result of years spent together at Barcelona.\n\n\n\nBut Palmeiras adjusted in the second half. Coach Abel Ferreira introduced Allan and Maur\u00edcio, who added energy and vertical threat. Palmeiras increased their final third entries from 34 in the first half to 58 by full-time. The shift paid dividends.\n\n\n\nStatistically, Palmeiras had more shots (22 to Miami\u2019s 8), more entries into the penalty area, and dominated aerial duels in the final third. Inter Miami, despite their quality in attack, suffered defensively under pressure \u2014 conceding twice from open play within 10 minutes.\n\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Trends, Debates & Rankings: Where Does OKC\u2019s 2025 Title Rank Among Recent NBA Champions?\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: The Reunion Everyone\u2019s Talking About\n\n\n\nInter Miami\u2019s draw sees them finish second in Group A, and that sets up one of the most anticipated fixtures of the Club World Cup so far: Lionel Messi vs. Paris Saint-Germain. The matchup has every ingredient for a global football story \u2014 personal history, elite talent, and massive stakes.\n\n\n\nFor Messi, it\u2019s a chance to remind the world that his departure from PSG was never about form, but fit. For PSG, it\u2019s an opportunity to eliminate one of the tournament\u2019s most marketable and dangerous squads.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Palmeiras move on as group leaders, and with their late surge against Inter Miami, they\u2019ve proven they can adapt and respond when it matters most.\n\n\n\nFinal Word\n\n\n\nThe situation is the same in football; moments count more than minutes. And although Inter Miami put in a brilliant 75-minute performance, their collapse in the last 15 minutes was what ended them. Nevertheless, the early genius moment by Messi did not fail to remind everyone why he is the key hope to Miami in this tournament.\n\n\n\nThe draw can be depressing now and the next game is a reunion long in coming so the chance of redemption could be at hand.\n\n\n\nMatch Summary:\n\n\n\n\nFinal Score: Inter Miami 2\u20132 Palmeiras\n\n\n\nScorers:\u202f \u202f \u2013 Inter Miami: Tadeo Allende (16\u2019), Luis Su\u00e1rez (65\u2019)\u202f \u202f \u2013 Palmeiras: Paulinho (80\u2019), Maur\u00edcio (87\u2019)\n\n\n\nVenue: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami\n\n\n\nAttendance: 60,914\n\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Luis Su\u00e1rez\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Fixture:\ud83d\udd1c Quarterfinal \u2014 Inter Miami vs Paris Saint-Germain\ud83d\udccd Venue TBD | \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f June 29, 2025 | \u23f0 Kick-off: 21:30 local time\n\n\n\nStay tuned \u2014 the drama is just getting started.\n",

Many fans and experts found his performance adoring, remarking that he has the skill to change the game to GT\u2019s favor from the first over itself.\n\n\n\nSiraj\u2019s spell was one of safe accuracy and sneaky variations. He used a mixture of pace and a few subtle slower balls to set an aggressive tone very early on. He then started with a string of well directed balls that made the top order of RCB hesitate. The early pressure was especially vital in preventing the opposition from having scoring chances. One of RCB\u2019s biggest difficulties was that Siraj kept constant line and length, preventing RCB from finding any rhythm.\n\n\n\nSiraj did manage to dismiss a big name with a sharp delivery and it was a good memory. The wicket wasn\u2019t only a blow for RCB batting but the turning of the match. This elicited a bright reaction from the crowd as many took to social media to express themselves. Siraj\u2019s bowling was a masterclass today, one fan said. He made every ball count.\u201d Such views echoed throughout cricket forums and expert columns on Cricbuzz.\n\n\n\nWhat a Spell \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd25@mdsirajofficial #MohammedSiraj #Siraj #GujaratTitans #RCBvsGT @CinemaPlusCric @Manojeditsoffl pic.twitter.com/lP0mhG7ae5\u2014 CinemaPlusCricket (@CinemaPlusCric) April 2, 2025 \n\n\n\nBeyond his technical skill, Siraj\u2019s attitude and focus underlined his performance. In post-match interviews, he highlighted the collective effort of his team while remaining confident about his own contribution. His approach was humble yet determined\u2014a blend that resonates well with supporters. Analysts on ESPNcricinfo noted that Siraj\u2019s early breakthroughs gave GT a strong platform, setting the stage for strategic field placements and further pressure from his teammates.\n\n\n\nHis spell did more than just claim wickets. It disrupted RCB\u2019s batting plans. When facing a well-composed lineup, every wicket counts. Siraj\u2019s delivery in the powerplay created a domino effect, forcing RCB to adjust their strategy. The knock-on impact was clear: as key batsmen were dismissed in quick succession, RCB\u2019s scoring rate slowed considerably. The Titans\u2019 coach later praised Siraj for his role in \u201cturning the game around in the early stages.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe conversation also involved the changing of pace bowling in T20 cricket. Siraj\u2019s approach was compared to previous classic spells by many observers, who pointed out how the disciplined bowling can be such an effective tool in high pressure games. RCB\u2019s batting strength played a significant role as they could lean on the bowlers, but it was the strong opening bowling which tied the match for GT.\n\n\n\nSolid fielding from the rest of the GT squad complemented the pressure applied by Siraj. It was quick reflexes behind the stumps and strategic field placements that helped to milk any mis hit. This collective way made Siraj\u2019s individual brilliance shine bright, along with a match plan drafted by combining success of either individuality or team harmony.\n\n\n\n\nVirat Kohli Creates Major IPL Record Against Gujarat Titans\n\n\n\nLSG Faces Home Game Setback in a Challenging IPL Start\n\n\n\n\nTheir performance also put into question the balance in teams in T20 cricket today. The debate amongst the critics and fans was whether teams should put their faith in bowling depth instead of relying solely on star batsmen. Udham was leading the charge and GT\u2019s are balance and effective strategy. He made an impact beyond wickets as well as set the tone for the match.\n\n\n\nThis spell from Siraj will stand out as a turning point in this season\u2019s tournament as the tournament continues. Against other fine batting lineups, his performance is a ball game example of how focused and disciplined bowling can control the flow of a game. For the rest of the match, these early decisions tend define the game, so teams will have to adapt for future fixtures and plan for such game changing spells.\n\n\n\nOverall, Mohammed Siraj\u2019s contribution went on beyond just his individual statistics. He played an important part in the match, influencing its result and providing GT with a way to push ahead. His extension of skill, focus and team spirit is worth taking note of by players and budding cricketers.As discussions continue on cricket forums and in expert reviews, Siraj\u2019s performance remains a highlight of this thrilling IPL season.\n",

The team from Lucknow Super Giants lost to Punjab Kings by eight wickets when Punjab completed the match with 22 balls remaining. The loss with Punjab Kings heavily impacted LSG\u2019s home performance statistics and now ranks them as the worst second over all IPL teams.\n\n\n\nPitch Concerns and Curator Comments\n\n\n\nZaheer Khan shared his dissatisfaction about how the pitch played better for the opponent team. He found the pitch seemed similar to how Punjab Kings\u2019 curator designed it instead of matching a regular Lucknow home pitch. Zaheer experienced minor displeasure at this home stadium because As the head of the home team he believed games should provide an advantage to the team playing on their own pitch. These circumstances benefited the opponents against LSG.\n\n\n\nRishabh Pant's post-auction comments came back to bite him after a heavy defeat against Punjab Kings in Lucknow \ud83e\udee2#IPL2025 #LSGvPBKS #LSG #PBKS pic.twitter.com/jcs04bW22n\u2014 Circle of Cricket (@circleofcricket) April 1, 2025 \n\n\n\nZaheer points to the need of preparing a field that helps local players when they play at home. Fans hope local players gain a meaningful edge on their own pitch during home matches according to Zaheer. The team did not gain their needed home-ground benefits because of strange game conditions. Zaheer wants to resolve this problem once and intends to partner with the pitch management group.\n\n\n\nTeam Performance and Strategy\n\n\n\nThe game strategy of LSG directly responded to pitch issues. LSG followed a special bowling strategy by using only two quick bowlers including the late inclusion of Shardul Thakur. They made the choice because of player injuries and scarce fast-bowling personnel available. The team hit difficulties because of their limited number of overseas fast bowlers especially just Shamar Joseph.\n\n\n\nFast Bowlers and Injuries\n\n\n\nInjuries to key fast bowlers meant that LSG could not rely on a strong pace attack. Punjab Kings took full advantage of this. Their fast-bowling trio\u2014Arshdeep Singh, Lockie Ferguson, and Marco Jansen\u2014delivered an impressive performance. They combined with Marcus Stoinis, who bowled two overs, to return figures of 5 for 112 in just 13 overs. The lack of sufficient pace in LSG\u2019s bowling line-up was a significant factor in their defeat.\n\n\n\nBatting Response and Fielding Efforts\n\n\n\nOn the batting side, the home team faced a tough challenge in building a competitive score. The batting lineup was put under pressure by the opposition\u2019s disciplined bowling attack. Fielding efforts were also scrutinized, as a missed opportunity in the field further eased the opponent\u2019s path to victory. Despite these setbacks, the team remains confident about turning their fortunes around in the remaining matches.\n\n\n\nExpert Opinions and Player Reactions\n\n\n\nCaptain Rishabh Pant and other senior players acknowledged the unexpected pitch behavior. Pant noted that the team had anticipated a slower surface that would aid their spin attack. This miscalculation was evident when the team opted to play three overs of spin during the powerplay. They believed that this change would restrict the pace attack of the opposition. However, the strategy did not work as planned.\n\n\n\nPant\u2019s insights underscore the learning curve that comes with adapting to unpredictable playing conditions. The captain mentioned that the team is still in the process of understanding the home conditions. Such moments often serve as learning experiences, allowing teams to adjust their strategies in upcoming games.\n\n\n\nExpert insights from former players and analysts have stressed the importance of home advantage in the IPL. They point out that conditions that favor local players can be a decisive factor in a team\u2019s performance. When the pitch does not deliver as expected, it not only impacts the current game but also affects the confidence of the home team. Analysts believe that addressing these issues promptly is essential for LSG to regain their momentum.\n\n\n\nA Broader Look at Home Advantage in the IPL\n\n\n\nThe disappointment faced by LSG is not an isolated incident. Other teams have also raised concerns about home conditions. Teams like Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings have noted challenges in getting a proper read on their home pitches. While CSK boasts the best home record in the league, even they have experienced difficulties due to inconsistent pitch behavior over the past two years.\n\n\n\nImpact on Team Morale and Fan Expectations\n\n\n\nHome games carry a unique pressure, as fans expect a win when their team plays on familiar turf. For LSG, this loss was particularly painful. The home crowd, which had high hopes for the season opener, was left frustrated. The support of the local fans is a significant boost for any team. When the pitch does not favor the home side, it can dampen both player morale and public confidence.\n\n\n\nZaheer stressed that every player\u2019s contribution is vital. He called on the broader support system, including the pitch management team and the fans, to help overcome these hurdles. The team is determined to learn from this experience and prepare better for upcoming home matches. The goal is to create a more balanced environment where home conditions help, rather than hinder, the team\u2019s performance.\n\n\n\nReal-Life Examples from Past Seasons\n\n\n\nLooking back at previous IPL seasons offers insight into the challenges of maintaining a true home advantage. In one season, another IPL team faced similar issues when the pitch did not play as expected. The opposition took full advantage, leading to a series of defeats that ultimately cost the team valuable points in the league standings. Such incidents remind us that even well-prepared teams must remain flexible and ready to adjust their strategies in response to unforeseen challenges.\n\n\n\nThe experience of past seasons reinforces the need for continuous collaboration between the team management and pitch curators. When both parties work together, they can create conditions that help local players perform to their best ability. Teams that have managed to secure consistent home advantage often benefit from this collaboration, which ultimately reflects in their win-loss record.\n\n\n\nThe Road Ahead for LSG\n\n\n\nLSG has six more games to play in the home leg of the season. The team has shown resilience throughout the season despite facing early setbacks. The current loss is seen as a learning opportunity. The coaching staff and players are working to identify areas that need improvement. They are focused on adjusting tactics to better suit the conditions expected in future games.\n\n\n\nThe team remains confident in its ability to bounce back. Discussions on team strategy have taken place, with a focus on enhancing both the batting and bowling approaches. The management is also in talks with the pitch curator to ensure that future conditions favor the home team. This proactive stance is expected to help restore the trust of the home supporters.\n\n\n\nThe journey ahead requires a collective effort from all involved. Each player\u2019s performance, combined with strong team support, is key to turning the season around. The management is also seeking ways to engage the local community and boost morale. A united approach can help mitigate the impact of a single game setback.\n\n\n\nThe experience of this match will likely serve as a turning point for the team. By addressing the pitch issues and revising game strategies, LSG can improve its performance in upcoming fixtures. The team\u2019s ability to learn from this experience will be critical as the season progresses.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe home defeat suffered by LSG in their season opener has raised several important questions. The pitch conditions, which appeared to favor the opposition, played a significant role in the loss. Comments from mentor Zaheer Khan and captain Rishabh Pant shed light on the team\u2019s struggle to gain the expected home advantage.\n\n\n\nLSG now faces the challenge of turning this experience into a catalyst for improvement. The team has recognized the need for adjustments in both strategy and preparation. With more games ahead, there is ample opportunity to refine their approach. The goal is to create conditions that enable local players to perform at their best.\n\n\n\nBy understanding and addressing the issues that led to this loss, LSG can aim for better results in the remainder of the season. The lessons learned will guide their future strategies, making them a stronger contender in the IPL. Fans and experts alike watch with anticipation, hopeful that the team will soon return to winning form on their home ground.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the challenges faced by LSG in their home game highlight the complex dynamics of cricket in the IPL. Addressing pitch concerns, refining team strategies, and fostering a collaborative spirit are essential steps. With determination and smart adjustments, the team looks forward to brighter performances in the games to come.\n",

His score of seven runs surpassed Ruturaj Gaikwad\u2019s 350 runs to make Kohli the number one run scorer against Gujarat Titans.\n\n\n\nVirat Kohli became the highest scorer against gt in ipl history with 351 runs in 7 matches #ipl #IPL2025 #RCBvsGT #ViratKohli pic.twitter.com/ZDLdHFHeTr\u2014 Sportspedia Zone (@Sportspediazone) April 2, 2025 \n\n\n\nThrough his exceptional performance Kohli collected the most scoring records versus the active IPL teams Gujarat Titans Delhi Capitals Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals. David Warner holds the top scorer position for active players across two teams against Punjab Kings (1134) and Kolkata Knight Riders (1093).\n\n\n\nMost Runs Against GT in IPL History:\n\n\n\n\nVirat Kohli \u2013 351 runs in 7 matches\n\n\n\nRuturaj Gaikwad \u2013 350 runs in 7 matches\n\n\n\nSuryakumar Yadav \u2013 248 runs in 5 matches\n\n\n\nSanju Samson \u2013 230 runs in 6 matches\n\n\n\nJos Buttler \u2013 198 runs in 6 matches\n\n\n\n\nA Legacy of Consistency\n\n\n\nKohli strikes repeatedly in IPL matches making an unmatched achievement record. Through many seasons he has delivered results against all teams successfully despite challenging situations. He performs well against multiple teams because he remains dynamic and wants to score many runs in each game.\n\n\n\nThrough his extensive IPL experience Kohli confirms his superior skill position and sustained excellence. RCB fans can still feel proud that Kohli remains important to the IPL although they may be unhappy about his early dismissal in this match.\n\n\n\nMatch Overview\n\n\n\nGujarat Titans won the start and decided to start the match by bowling first. GT skipper Shubman Gill warned his team members to lower their mistakes while needing to change their strategies. Ticketek captain Rajat Patidar assured the public after winning the toss he had full faith in his players and their home crowd backing.\n\n\n\n\nLSG Faces Home Game Setback in a Challenging IPL Start\n\n\n\n\nAs the match progressed Kohli demonstrated his familiar skills by hitting a perfect drive for four with his bat. His batting innings ended hastily when he swung at a shot against Arshad Khan and flew the ball straight to Prasidh Krishna who caught it beyond the boundary.\n\n\n\nThe upcoming IPL 2025 season offers Kohli several chances to achieve more batting feats although his journey has just begun. Through his running hunger and focused performance Kohli will achieve more batting records in the future.\n\n\n\nHe can proudly add this moment to his IPL legacy which shows why he ranks among its top batting performers ever.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe confetti hadn\u2019t even finished falling at Paycom Center before the conversations began: Where does this Oklahoma City Thunder (OKC) championship rank among recent NBA title runs? In a league shaped by player movement, big-market dominance, and constant power shifts, the Thunder\u2019s 2025 triumph stands out \u2014 not just because of what they achieved, but how they did it.\n\n\n\nTheir 103\u201391 Game 7 win over the Indiana Pacers gave Oklahoma City its first NBA title since the franchise moved from Seattle in 2008. But it also gave us a rare championship story \u2014 one that feels different from the recent past. Let\u2019s break down why this Thunder run matters, where it ranks, and why it might be remembered as more than just a title\u2026 but the start of something bigger.\n\n\n\nThe Night Everything Changed: Game 7 and a Franchise\u2019s Finest Hour\n\n\n\nYou could feel the tension in the building from the opening tip. The Paycom Center was electric. It was loud, it was personal, and it was historic.\n\n\n\nIt was extra special considering that it was a Game 7 in the NBA Finals and it was extra-special with another layer of seriousness. That game was the first Game 7 in league Finals since 2016 when LeBron became the face of Cleveland and led the team to that historic turnaround win against the Warriors. To the residents of Oklahoma City, basketball was not the only thing. It was a city that had gotten behind a home grown team that was young and which had taken the city through the finest season it had ever had.\n\n\n\nThe defining moment was the Thunder scoring a 34 point second half on the strength of 34-20 in the third quarter run after the Oklahoma team went point-to-point in the first half to end 56 56. Gilgeous-Alexander, Holmgren, and Williams made back-to-back three-point shots, and the game was not in sight anymore.\n\n\n\nAnd it was a great lesson that not only championship teams win games, but they capture moments. And the Thunder did that when the lights were brightest.\n\n\n\nSGA: A Star Cemented in History\n\n\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander had been building to this all year. But what he accomplished in Game 7 \u2014 and throughout the 2024\u201325 season \u2014 now puts him in rare company. He poured in 29 points and dished out 12 assists in the championship clincher, playing with the kind of calm and control you expect from someone with rings on his fingers \u2014 not someone playing in his first Finals.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what makes it special: SGA became just the fifth player in NBA history to win the regular season MVP, the scoring title, and an NBA championship in the same season. The others? Legends. The Finals MVP trophy was the final stamp on what will be remembered as one of the great individual seasons in modern NBA history.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow did OKC win the finals?\u201d pic.twitter.com/xolMkE2h11\u2014 Hoops (@HoopMixOnly) June 23, 2025 \n\n\n\nNor was it a story of an individual brilliance. The manner in which SGA led was unselfish, unshaken and unwavering and therefore it was easy to have teammates who raise their game.\n\n\n\nThe Numbers Don\u2019t Lie: Why This Thunder Team Was Historically Great\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk numbers, because this Thunder team didn\u2019t just win \u2014 they dominated.\n\n\n\n\n68\u201314 Regular Season Record: Tied for sixth-best in NBA history.\n\n\n\n+12.87 Point Differential: The best ever, surpassing the iconic 1971\u201372 Lakers.\n\n\n\nLeague-leading defense: Their defensive rating led the league, and it showed in the playoffs.\n\n\n\n\nIn their final 10 games of the postseason, they averaged 115.6 points while holding opponents to just under 108 \u2014 a balance that highlights how efficient and locked-in this team was on both ends.\n\n\n\nUnlike some teams that flame out after a strong regular season, the Thunder sustained their excellence all the way through the playoffs. That consistency is what puts them in the conversation with historically elite champions.\n\n\n\nA Small-Market Win That\u2019s Big for the League\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s something special about seeing a small-market team cut down the nets. Oklahoma City and Indiana represented the smallest combined media market in NBA Finals history. And yet, the basketball was as compelling as anything we\u2019ve seen in years.\n\n\n\nSure, Game 1 drew modest ratings (just 8.91 million viewers), but the drama of a Game 7 finale \u2014 and the emergence of young stars \u2014 captivated fans by the end. And for the league, it was a powerful message: great basketball isn\u2019t confined to New York, LA, or Miami.\n\n\n\nThis win didn\u2019t just belong to Oklahoma City. It belonged to every fan in every small NBA city who dreams of their team doing things the right way and reaching the mountaintop.\n\n\n\nWhere Does This Championship Rank? Let\u2019s Compare\n\n\n\nIn the modern era of parity \u2014 seven champions in seven years \u2014 OKC\u2019s title might be the most complete from top to bottom.\n\n\n\nRecent NBA Champions:\n\n\n\n\n2025: Thunder (68-14)\n\n\n\n2024: Celtics (64-18)\n\n\n\n2023: Nuggets (53-29)\n\n\n\n2022: Warriors (58-24)\n\n\n\n2021: Bucks (46-26)\n\n\n\n2020: Lakers (52-19)\n\n\n\n2019: Raptors (58-24)\n\n\n\n\nWhat separates the Thunder?\n\n\n\n\nDominance \u2013 Their regular season was among the best ever, and they backed it up with a championship.\n\n\n\nYouth \u2013 SGA is just 26. Holmgren and Williams are 23 and 22. This core could rule the league for a decade.\n\n\n\nGame 7 Composure \u2013 Not only did they win a Game 7, they won it comfortably. A 12-point margin in a Finals Game 7 is rare \u2014 and it says a lot about their poise.\n\n\n\n\nFor reference, most Game 7s are grinding, one-possession affairs. Think:\n\n\n\n\n2016: Cavs 93, Warriors 89\n\n\n\n2013: Heat 95, Spurs 88\n\n\n\n2010: Lakers 83, Celtics 79\n\n\n\n\nOKC didn\u2019t just survive. They finished with authority.\n\n\n\nThe Blueprint: A Championship Built, Not Bought\n\n\n\nThere was no shortcut here. This wasn\u2019t a superteam slapped together in a summer. This was six years in the making.\n\n\n\nSam Presti\u2019s 2019 trade of Paul George set it in motion \u2014 bringing back SGA and a mountain of draft capital. Then came smart drafting: Jalen Williams at No. 12 in 2022, Chet Holmgren in 2022 (though he missed his rookie year), and savvy veteran additions like Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein.\n\n\n\nThe result? A deep, versatile team that won on both ends of the floor and had answers for everything the playoffs threw at them.\n\n\n\nCulture, Character, and Clutch Play\n\n\n\nChampionships are won with talent. But sustained success comes from culture. This Thunder group played for each other. You could see it in the way they celebrated stops, moved the ball, and trusted the system.\n\n\n\nAnd when it mattered most, they didn\u2019t blink. Whether it was Jalen Williams dropping 40 in Game 5 or Lu Dort\u2019s lockdown defense in the clutch, this team had clutch DNA.\n\n\n\nThey forced 21 turnovers in Game 7 \u2014 a ridiculous number for a Finals game. That wasn\u2019t luck. That was preparation, discipline, and a defensive identity that never wavered.\n\n\n\nA City Celebrates \u2013 And the League Takes Notice\n\n\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, Oklahoma City erupted. Fans leapt into the Bricktown Canals. Horns blared down Sheridan Avenue. Mayor David Holt declared a citywide holiday and announced a championship parade before dawn.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just about a title \u2014 it was about pride, perseverance, and proof that a city often overlooked had climbed to the top of the basketball world.\n\n\n\nAnd from a league standpoint? The message was just as loud: You don\u2019t need a coastal zip code to build a contender. You just need vision.\n\n\n\nWhat Comes Next: The Dynasty Conversation Begins\n\n\n\nThis may have been the Thunder\u2019s first championship since moving to Oklahoma, but it might not be their last \u2014 not by a long shot.\n\n\n\nWith their three key stars under 27, a war chest of draft picks, and one of the NBA\u2019s best front offices, the Thunder are positioned to become the next long-term powerhouse.\n\n\n\nAlready, people are making comparisons to the Warriors in 2015 \u2014 a young core that learned together and won early. But OKC might have an even better foundation on the defensive end, which tends to hold up over time.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts: More Than a Championship\n\n\n\nWhen we look back on the 2025 NBA season, it won\u2019t just be remembered for the Thunder\u2019s win. It will be remembered for how they won \u2014 with humility, hard work, and a belief in the process.\n\n\n\nThis title wasn\u2019t just a reward. It was a validation \u2014 of smart drafting, patient rebuilding, and the idea that you don\u2019t have to chase stars when you can develop your own.\n\n\n\nWhere does OKC\u2019s 2025 championship rank among the greats? That depends on what they do next. But right now, it feels like the beginning of something bigger \u2014 not just for Oklahoma City, but for the NBA.\n\n\n\nA title for the history books. And maybe, the start of a dynasty.\n",

A 34\u201320 explosion \u2014 fueled by the dazzling command of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the two-way poise of Jalen Williams \u2014 turned a tight game into a chokehold. Indiana never truly recovered.\n\n\n\nA Masterclass in Momentum: The 34-20 Quarter That Changed Everything\n\n\n\nAt halftime, Oklahoma City led 47\u201344. Balanced. Wobbly, even. The Thunder had flashes, but the Pacers were staying alive with aggressive defense and physical rebounding. But the third quarter? That\u2019s where the game tipped permanently \u2014 emotionally, tactically, and statistically.\n\n\n\nOKC\u2019s 34-point third wasn\u2019t just about shot-making \u2014 though they did plenty of that. It was a clinic in control, tempo, and disruption. It felt like every Thunder possession either ended in a clean bucket or a trip to the free-throw line. Meanwhile, Indiana unraveled under suffocating ball pressure, coughing up turnover after turnover \u2014 seven in that quarter alone, part of 21 total on the night.\n\n\n\nYOUR 2025 @NBA CHAMPIONS \ud83c\udfc6#ThunderUp pic.twitter.com/e1PghAzHG9\u2014 OKC THUNDER (@okcthunder) June 23, 2025 \n\n\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander: The Composer of Chaos\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to look at the box score \u2014 29 points, 12 assists \u2014 and call it a star\u2019s performance. But Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s night was more than numbers. This was leadership under fire. Every time the Pacers started to press, SGA slowed the game down and made the right read. He found mismatches, attacked with purpose, and made Indiana\u2019s defense chase shadows.\n\n\n\nTwo plays stood out in that third quarter. First, a driving and-one finish over Myles Turner that sent the home crowd into a frenzy. Then, a no-look dime to a cutting Jalen Williams that perfectly encapsulated OKC\u2019s unselfish ethos.\n\n\n\nGilgeous-Alexander didn\u2019t force the issue. He orchestrated it.\n\n\n\nJalen Williams: Calm in the Storm\n\n\n\nWhile SGA was the engine, Jalen Williams was the equilibrium. His 20 points came on patient, purposeful offense \u2014 timely threes, midrange pull-ups, and off-ball cuts that broke Indiana\u2019s defensive shape. But his impact ran deeper.\n\n\n\nWilliams\u2019 ability to guard multiple positions, contest shots, and switch fluidly allowed OKC to blitz Indiana\u2019s backcourt without overcommitting. That flexibility disrupted Tyrese Haliburton, who played just 7 minutes due to recurring knee soreness, and put extra pressure on Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell to create \u2014 pressure they couldn\u2019t withstand.\n\n\n\nDefense, Discipline, and the Power of Pressure\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s where the Thunder truly won the game: 14 steals. Fourteen. That\u2019s not just active hands \u2014 that\u2019s a defense playing with full anticipation, reading passing lanes, and out-hustling their opponent.\n\n\n\nLu Dort (7 rebounds, 1 key late-game steal) embodied OKC\u2019s defensive grit. So did rookie Cason Wallace and vet Alex Caruso, who rotated seamlessly and took charges like seasoned playoff warriors.\n\n\n\nIndiana\u2019s 21 turnovers? That was the byproduct of that constant pressure. Even the free throw disparity \u2014 OKC shot just 71% (22/31) \u2014 didn\u2019t matter because the Thunder created nearly double-digit more scoring opportunities from Pacers\u2019 errors.\n\n\n\nThe Big Picture: A New Era in Oklahoma City\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to think about how this Game 7 win marks a symbolic shift in the NBA landscape. This wasn\u2019t a superteam. No overpaid mercenaries. No trade deadline blockbusters. This was a home-grown, methodically built team peaking together at the perfect time.\n\n\n\nThe youngest roster to win a title since the 1977 Trail Blazers did it not by overpowering opponents but by outthinking them, out-executing them, and \u2014 in the decisive third quarter of Game 7 \u2014 flat-out outplaying them.\n\n\n\nClosing Thought: The Third Quarter Wasn\u2019t a Moment. It Was a Message.\n\n\n\nWhen historians trace how the 2025 NBA Finals were decided, they\u2019ll circle the third quarter of Game 7 in bold. Because in those 12 minutes, Oklahoma City Thunder didn\u2019t just claim a championship \u2014 they announced themselves.\n\n\n\nSGA and Jalen Williams carried the torch, but it was a team-wide storm that swept the Pacers away. And in that storm, a dynasty might just have been born.\n",

An audience of 10,428 people saw Jewell Loyd make the game of the season with her final minutes performance to secure her seasonal legacy and prove once again the strength of Storm.\n\n\n\nInitial Battles and Moments of Shifts\n\n\n\nThe game began at high tempo. The Seattle team made the first move and took 23-21 at the end of the first quarter. The second was a reply as Las Vegas ascended to 45-38 in the first half with active play and scores on defensive rebounds.\n\n\n\nIn the third period, Seattle rebounded with 29 points to that of 21 by the Aces with the end of the third period being tied at 66-66. Defense stepped up, and each team did not have much control of the lead.\n\n\n\nLoyd\u2019s Heroics in Crunch Time\n\n\n\nWith 9:22 left in the fourth, Loyd nailed a deep three\u2011pointer to push Seattle ahead 69\u201167. This shot shifted energy in favor of the Storm (espn.com). As the clock ticked under two minutes, Loyd remained cool under pressure, earning two free throws with 2:15 left and extending the edge to 88\u201181 (aces.wnba.com).\n\n\n\nHer 15 points, three rebounds, and four assists in 34 minutes were timely despite not being the highest scorer on her squad. Loyd later reflected, \u201cI just tried to stay focused and make the shots when they counted.\u201d Teammate Skylar Diggins praised her: \u201cJewell is always clutch in big moments. We knew she\u2019d come through.\u201d Although recent, these quotes came through ESPN\u2019s AP recap .\n\n\n\nTeam Effort: Stars Shine on Both Sides\n\n\n\nSeattle shot a balanced 46.5% from the field (33/71) and hit 81.3% (13/16) at the line. Nneka Ogwumike had a dominant game with 25 points and 12 rebounds. She also recorded two steals, becoming the No.\u00a06 all\u2011time WNBA leader in steals with 636. Skylar Diggins added 24 points and six assists. Gabby Williams registered her first professional double\u2011double with 18 points and 12 boards. Bench player Erica Wheeler contributed 17 points, 10 of which came in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nOn the opposing side, the Aces nearly turned the tide. Jackie Young scored 22 points with five assists. A\u2019ja Wilson, back from concussion protocol, recorded 20 points and 14 rebounds but also committed seven turnovers. Rookie Aaliyah Nye posted a season\u2011high 13 points.\n\n\n\nLas Vegas went 14/21 on free throws (67%), and committed 14 turnovers factors that proved costly .\n\n\n\nSeattle\u2019s Defensive Stand in Final Stretch\n\n\n\nSeattle\u2019s defense locked in during crunch time, holding the Aces to just 17 points in the fourth quarter. Their early run sparked by Wheeler and Diggins led to a decisive 9\u20112 surge that capped at 88\u201181. Las Vegas then missed three straight field goals, hit only three free throws, and committed two turnovers in the final 5\u00bd minutes .\n\n\n\nAlso Read \u2013 Vinicius Junior\u2019s INSANE Influence: Revolutionizing Real Madrid\n\n\n\nImpact on Standings and Playoff Race\n\n\n\nThe win improved Seattle\u2019s record to 8\u20115, keeping them in third place in the Western Conference . Meanwhile, Las Vegas dropped to 5\u20117, slipping into fifth. The loss marked the Aces\u2019 third consecutive defeat and just their second three\u2011game skid since the 2020 WNBA Finals, when Seattle swept them.\n\n\n\nSeattle has now won five of its last six games, reinforcing their identity as a team capable of adjusting and executing in tight moments .\n\n\n\nWhat This Win Says About Loyd\n\n\n\nLoyd\u2019s switch from former team Seattle to Las Vegas in February made summer headlines. She was the No.\u00a01 overall pick in 2015 and a six\u2011time All-Star. Despite her new team, her affinity for clutch moments with Seattle remains intact .\n\n\n\nHer timely shooting and composure earned praise after the game. Seattle\u2019s ability to rely on her in crunch time shows that even away from her former home, Loyd continues to define games\u2014and this win highlighted her still\u2011elite late\u2011game presence.\n\n\n\nKey Stats Snapshot\n\n\n\nTeamFG%3\u2011PMFT%RebTOKey PlayersSEA46.5% (33/71)11/2381.3%3711Ogwumike, Diggins, Williams, LoydLV47.5% (29/61)11/1966.7%3014Young, Wilson, Loyd, Nye\n\n\n\nSeattle created second\u2011chance opportunities on defense and trusted rotations in crunch while Vegas couldn\u2019t find consistent free\u2011throw accuracy and committed too many turnovers.\n\n\n\nThe Road Ahead: What\u2019s Next\n\n\n\nSeattle\u2019s next opponent is the New York Liberty on June\u202f23, followed by a June\u202f25 visit from the Indiana Fever. They\u2019ll look to build on this momentum and reinforce their Western Conference spot.\n\n\n\nLas Vegas, meanwhile, will host Caitlin Clark and Indiana Fever on June\u202f23, then face Connecticut Sun on June\u202f26. Three consecutive home games offer a chance to halt the skid\u2014but mental toughness and consistent free\u2011throw shooting will be critical.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nJewell Loyd has given fans the reminder of she is the gold Mamba with ice in her veins and the space to turn the momentum at the right time. Her late free-throws and three point basket were just a performance that when coupled with Seattle collective performance took over a hostile arena.\n\n\n\nIt was predetermined as a seesaw battle of poise in crunch time, but on the whole, this game portrayed Seattle as a mix of both stars and role players and defense. In the case of Las Vegas, a loss this evening brings up old problems: turnovers, poor free-throw shooting, and free-throw shooting pressure later in the game.\n\n\n\nThese two teams have played against each other exactly three times this season, but the edge in their head\u2011to\u2011head record now belongs to Seattle as the team now holds a 2-1 record. This victory confirmed again that Seattle is able to shut down when it matters. And the performance of Loyd was a pre-cursor of her future influence\u2013whatever the uniform, Loyd will come through when it is time to make it count.\n",

His scorching speed, brilliant dribbling and instinct to exchange the epic moments have made him one of the brightest and eager prospects in global football. However, in the last two days, June 20 to 21, 2025, his presence within the club has been the burning topic both on and off the pitch which after critical discussions has divided fans and analysts of the club.\n\n\n\nRough Beginning to the Club World Cup\n\n\n\nOn June 18, 2025, Real Madrid opened their 2025 FIFA Club World Cup with an exasperating draw against Saudi juggernauts Al-Hilal in a 1:1 ordeal. Whereas the outcome of the game was not impressive, the poor performance of Vinicius Junior attracted a lot of attention. \n\n\n\nOn the left-side, the Brazilian was not able to stamp his authority, and with very few successful dribbles, he had no direct goal involvements, as well. Supporters and commentators soared to social media in the days after especially on 20 and 21 June to express dissatisfaction with his performance with some even asserting that his form has dropped just when the season needed him.\n\n\n\nVinicius Jr did all this for them and they\u2019re turning on him, Madrid fans are the scummiest fanbase of all time pic.twitter.com/yTw6bTc3rF\u2014 \u034f\u034f\u034f\ud835\udc09\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32 \u2316 (@cagiago_) June 21, 2025 \n\n\n\nSuch performance has given rise to some eyebrows, considering the fact that Vinicius earns a reputation as a player who excels in crunch games. Was it a down day, or an indication of bigger problems? It remains to be seen by the jury, and it is a weak blot on an otherwise perfect sto-ry to the club.\n\n\n\nInstagram Drama Fuels Speculation\n\n\n\nAs if his on-field struggles weren\u2019t enough, Vinicius sent shockwaves through the Real Madrid faithful with a cryptic move on June 20, 2025. The 24-year-old removed \u201cReal Madrid\u201d from his Instagram bio and unpinned all club-related posts from his profile. In the world of modern football, where social media often doubles as a public statement, this subtle shift ignited a firestorm of speculation. Could Vinicius be hinting at discontent? Is a blockbuster transfer on the horizon? Fans wasted no time dissecting the move, with opinions ranging from panic to dismissal of it as mere noise.\n\n\n\nWhile no official statement has come from Vinicius or the club as of June 21, the timing\u2014hot on the heels of his Club World Cup showing\u2014only amplifies the uncertainty surrounding his current mindset.\n\n\n\nFan Reactions: Love, Criticism, and Everything In Between\n\n\n\nThe Real Madrid fanbase has never been one to hold back, and the past two days have showcased their passion in full force. On X, reactions to Vinicius\u2019s recent actions have been a mixed bag, reflecting both his polarizing influence and the high expectations placed upon him.\n\n\n\nOne critical voice came from @JaeyofRma, who posted on June 21, 2025:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cVini just did the minimal against Bayern and was hyped more than joselu, scored when we were already winning and was hyped more than courtois who saved us in the 1st half. They also want to give rodrygo, courtois and benzema\u2019s glory of 2022 to him because of a tap-in in the final.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nConversely, supporters like @Cr7stianismo_ remain unwavering in their belief in Vinicius\u2019s potential. Also on June 21, 2025, they wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAunque me quede yo solo en este barco. Me da igual. Vin\u00edcius Junior va a hacer historia en el Real Madrid. M\u00e1s de la que ya ha hecho. Va a volver a ser el mejor futbolista del mundo. Y vais a mamar todos uno por uno.\u201d(Translation: \u201cEven if I\u2019m the only one left on this ship, I don\u2019t care. Vinicius Junior will make history at Real Madrid. More than he already has. He\u2019ll be the best footballer in the world again. And you\u2019ll all eat your words one by one.\u201d)\n\n\n\n\nThese contrasting takes highlight the divisive nature of Vinicius\u2019s current moment\u2014some see a player overhyped for past glories, while others see a future legend poised for a comeback.\n\n\n\nThe Bigger Picture: Contract Talks and Beyond\n\n\n\nWhile not directly tied to the last 1-2 days, the backdrop of Vinicius\u2019s ongoing contract negotiations with Real Madrid adds context to the current saga. Earlier reports in June 2025 hinted at a potential extension until 2030, with a hefty \u20ac100 million package over five years. Yet, as of June 21, no deal has been finalized, leaving his long-term future at the club in limbo. This uncertainty only heightens the stakes of his recent performances and social media activity, as fans wonder whether he\u2019s fully committed to the Real Madrid project.\n\n\n\nConclusion: A Revolution at a Crossroads\n\n\n\nThe effect of Vinicius Junior on Real Madrid is no less recognizable but, at the same time, complicated. Two days have passed since his stress on Al-Hilal, his Instagram shake-up, and the subsequent audience reactions have created an image of a coach standing at a turning point in his career. He has turned the club-upside down with his swagger and daring, and these new happenings imply that his time at Los Blancos may have taken another turn- in a rather inexperienced direction.\n\n\n\nVinicius will be on everyone eyes as the Real Madrid team gears up to play their next Club World Cup 2016. Will he be able to shut down the critics and restore his position of being the heart of this team? Will the noise increase? There is one undisputed fact that one can hold on love him or hate him, Vinicus Junior is not going away.\n",

      "content_full": "\nThe retirement of Virat Kohli from Test cricket on 12th May 2025 will close a historic period of the Indian cricket. Speaking in the message posted on Instagram, he mentioned \u201cquiet grind\u201d long days and little moments that molded him into whites. The 36 year old exits the format days after teammate Rohit Sharma did. His timing is revealing of more than that shift in selection dynamics. It implies a man that hears his inner voice, instead of the outside opinion.\n\n\n\nIn 14 years, Kohli has played 123 Tests and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85. He occupies India\u2019s fourth place in the country\u2019s all-time Test run-scoring behind Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar. He struck 30 centuries and 31 fifties. Seven of those tons did come in, nine against Australia and an extraordinary six innings of 150 and above. His record shows both consistency and the capability to perform under intolerable pressure.\n\n\n\nAs captain between 2014 and 2022, Kohli played 68 tests for India. That side won 40 of those matches, the highest number recorded by any Indian leader since only Ricky Ponting, Graeme Smith and Steve Waugh have more victories internationally. His captaincy led India to two World Test Championship finals, the first in 2021 at The Oval. His very own ethos was a grit and discipline that characterized the defeat of his team.\n\n\n\nCongrats to my biscotti @imVkohli on an epic Test career! Your determination & skill have always inspired me. True legend! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb #ViratKohli\ud80c\udcf5 pic.twitter.com/2DnNLRzSrI\u2014 AB de Villiers (@ABdeVilliers17) May 12, 2025 \n\n\n\nTest cricket was not all about runs and records to Kohli. It was his reflection of character. He came under his sharpest challenge off the field when he first exploded on the scene as an 18-year-old. Just hours after his father\u2019s sudden death, in December 2006 he resumed batting for Delhi against Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy. He made 90 runs to deny his side from being follow-on, exited the ground to carry out last rites of his father. Those innings made that one his defining moment of his career \u2013 proof of a resolve that eventually speared him on to the highest peak of the international cricket.\n\n\n\nKohli led India to Under-19 World Cup triumph in Malaysia in 2008 Under-19 World Cup. He took the team from the front with 235 runs at an average of 47.00 including one century declared the \u201cinnings of the tournament\u201d by ESPNcricinfo. That success accelerated him into the senior playing team. His first ever series in 2011 against the West Indies had him making over 60 to an average, a clear indication of things to come.\n\n\n\nBut greatness took its toll. In the three years between January 2022, and January 2025, Kohli could only score three Test centuries. He confessed to having difficulties with form and mental stress, fighting a depression bout in the tour of England, 2014. He turned to Sachin Tendulkar for tips on how he can restore his confidence. When he resurrected his dismal form for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and displayed moments of the old fire, the calm he found in franchise cricket could not eclipse the burden of playing for his country in Tests.\n\n\n\nWhat Test cricket \u201ctaught me lessons I\u2019ll carry for life\u201d was made evident in Kohli\u2019s retirement statement. That expression describes more than field problems. It is a reflection of the war he waged \u2013 balancing family life with international commitments, living up to an image which fans and media gave him \u201cKing Kohli\u201d and handling identity issues that stardom often brings. He copped to having \u201cfaked intensity\u201d on occasion: doing a persona rather than just playing the game.\n\n\n\nOnwards in the future, India\u2019s white-ball will still revolve around Kohli. The 2027 World Cup is on his radar, with ODIs and T20Is on the radar in the immediate future. He will have to be able to adjust his technique and make an effort to control his labour as he juggles franchise tasks and national responsibilities. What fans can expect is that hard cover drives and the cutting running between the wickets they were accustomed to during his Test career.\n\n\n\nThere were tributes galore on social media and dressing rooms. Sachin Tendulkar talked in aw of Kohli\u2019s passion. He praised his competitive spirit. ICC chair Jay Shah thanked him for \u2018championing the purest format during the rise of T20 cricket\u201d. For a player who was previously damned for wrong temperament what he earned in respect form team-mates and even opponents is much.\n\n\n\nIllustrious legacy \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3Inspiring intensity \ud83d\udc4fIncredible icon \u2764\ufe0fThe Former #TeamIndia Captain gave it all to Test Cricket \ud83d\ude4cThank you for the memories in whites, Virat Kohli \ud83e\udee1#ViratKohli | @imVkohli pic.twitter.com/febCkcFhoC\u2014 BCCI (@BCCI) May 12, 2025 \n\n\n\nVirat Kohli\u2019s Test career started under kliegs of Delhi and finished on world renown stages of Lord\u2019s and Melbourne. Between those, there are agony and triumph moments: century in Adelaide, representing debut, heroic 97 at Lord\u2019s, record chase of Chennai. His is a story of tireless self improvement and given commitment.\n\n\n\nNow, as he moves away from the whites Test cricket loses one of the greatest contemporary artists. His next move \u2013 on limited-overs\u2019 stage, as mentor, or even as a commentator, will surely be charged with the same keenness. But for that silent grind in whites he will forever be remembered as a man who had nothing to spare a player who came out like a Turner in a battering ram nailing me to the cross where indeed he walked away.\n",
