<p>Right now, AMC's stock is trading at <strong>$2.45</strong>. The technical indicators are pointing to a bearish pattern because the price is holding below both its 50-day (<strong>$2.53</strong>) and 200-day (<strong>$2.91</strong>) moving averages. This suggests the stock has faced some recent headwinds, despite a minor gain over the last couple of weeks. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at <strong>63.9</strong>, indicating a neutral zone—neither overbought nor oversold. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator shows a neutral trend at <strong>0.04</strong>, hinting at potential minor pullbacks before a clearer directional move emerges.</p>
<p>Looking back over the past year, AMC's stock has traded between <strong>$2.05 and $5.56</strong>. This wide range tells us two important things: first, the stock has significantly pulled back from its highs, and second, the current price is near the lower end of that range. This might imply that massive swings are less likely without a major catalyst. Analysts have a pretty divergent outlook, with a 1-year target of <strong>$0.01 (-99.5%)</strong> from some models and an average consensus target of <strong>$3.21 (+31.0%)</strong> from others. Additionally, with <strong>52.39% institutional ownership</strong> and a moderate <strong>9.49% short interest</strong>, it appears institutions hold a significant stake, while some investors are still betting against the stock.</p>
<h2>AMC Stock Price Forecast: Unpacking Future Projections</h2>
<p>Understanding where a stock might go is crucial for any investment decision. While no one has a crystal ball, sophisticated models can provide a range of possibilities. The chart below (conceptually represented here as we cannot display actual images) typically illustrates recent average prices alongside a forecasted price range (Low, Average, High) derived from a predictive model like Prophet. This visual helps put the detailed monthly projections into perspective.</p>
<h3>AMC Entertainment (AMC) Monthly Price Forecast: A Closer Look</h3>
<p>The detailed monthly forecast outlines the model's expectations for AMC's price evolution from late 2025 through late 2026. These projections include minimum, average, and maximum price ranges, along with potential Return on Investment (ROI) compared to the current price of <strong>$2.45</strong>, and a derived model signal for each period. It's a comprehensive look at the potential future path.</p>

<p>Over the forecast horizon, from November 2025 to November 2026, the model projects AMC's price to fluctuate significantly, ranging between approximately <strong>$0.00</strong> and <strong>$61.74</strong>. The projected price range, from an initial <strong>$2.45 – $2.45</strong> to a later <strong>$0.00 – $41.75</strong>, implies a degree of stable forecast uncertainty, with some very low average price points in the mid-term. This suggests that while there's potential for high maximums, the average outlook is quite conservative.</p>
<p>It's vital to remember that these forecasts come from models and inherently carry uncertainty. They can change rapidly with new data, unexpected news, or shifts in market sentiment. Future prices are never guaranteed, so always factor in this inherent variability.

<h2>AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC): Company Profile &amp; Business Overview</h2>
<p>Before diving deeper into the financials, let's establish a clear understanding of AMC's business. Knowing what the company does provides essential context for interpreting the numbers.</p>

<h3>Business Overview</h3>
<p>AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., through its various subsidiaries, is primarily involved in the theatrical exhibition business across the United States and Europe. Essentially, they own, operate, or hold interests in movie theaters. The company has a long history, founded back in 1920, and is headquartered in Leawood, Kansas. They are a major player in bringing the big-screen experience to audiences.</p>
<h3>AMC Valuation Insights: Market Cap, Enterprise Value, and Key Ratios</h3>
<p>When we look at AMC, the market views it as a significant player in the Entertainment industry, boasting a <strong>$1.26 billion</strong> market capitalization. However, its enterprise value, which accounts for both equity and debt, is much higher at <strong>$9.09 billion</strong>. A substantial portion of that value, precisely <strong>$7.83 billion</strong>, comes from its debt load. While investors might be confident about AMC's future earnings potential, that considerable debt is definitely a factor to keep in mind.</p>
<p>The valuation ratios paint an interesting picture. With an EV/Revenue (TTM) of <strong>1.87x</strong> and an EV/EBITDA (TTM) of <strong>24.36x</strong>, AMC appears to be trading at a premium compared to many of its peers. This premium often reflects the company's strong market position and valuable brand assets. But, it also implies that the stock might have less room for error. Essentially, you're paying for quality, but quality doesn't always come cheap.</p>

<h3>AMC Stock Share Statistics: Ownership, Float, and Short Interest Dynamics</h3>
<p>Let's talk about who owns AMC and how much of its stock is available for trading. About <strong>9.9%</strong> of the company's shares are closely held by insiders or strategic investors, leaving a substantial <strong>462 million</strong> shares available for public trading (the "float"). Because the float is quite high, investors can usually trade this stock without causing major, sudden price shifts. However, it's always worth remembering that the company could issue more shares in the future, which might dilute the value of existing stock.</p>
<p>It's notable that executives and major shareholders own a relatively small portion of the company, at just <strong>0.43%</strong>. This sometimes means they don't have a huge amount of "skin in the game" if the company encounters difficulties. On the flip side, institutional ownership is quite healthy, coming in at <strong>52.39%</strong>. This level of institutional backing can provide a degree of stability and confidence in the stock.</p>
<p>Now, let's consider the impact of short interest. With <strong>48 million</strong> shares currently shorted, representing <strong>9.49%</strong> of the float, there's a noticeable level of bearish sentiment. It's wise to keep an eye on changes in short interest; a sharp increase could signal growing doubt among investors. Conversely, very low short interest during positive news might discourage a "short squeeze," where a rapid price increase forces short sellers to buy back shares.</p>

<h3>AMC Entertainment (AMC) Valuation Ratios: P/S, P/B, and EV Multiples</h3>
<p>Delving into AMC's valuation metrics reveals some interesting dynamics. The company's Forward P/E ratio stands at <strong>-3.55x</strong>. Negative P/E ratios are common for companies that are not currently profitable but have future earnings expectations, requiring a closer look at the underlying business model and growth prospects. Meanwhile, its Price/Sales ratio of <strong>$0.26</strong> and Price/Book of <strong>$-0.71</strong> offer additional perspectives on its market positioning relative to its revenue and book value. A negative Price/Book ratio often indicates that a company has negative shareholder equity.</p>
<p>From an enterprise value standpoint, the EV/Revenue ratio of <strong>1.87x</strong> suggests a reasonable valuation based on its top-line performance. However, the EV/EBITDA multiple of <strong>24.36x</strong> could imply that the company's valuation is somewhat stretched when considering its operational profitability before non-cash expenses, interest, and taxes. These metrics provide a comprehensive view, allowing investors to assess AMC's current market positioning from various angles.</p>

<h2>AMC's Financial Health: Liquidity, Cash Flow, and Debt Analysis</h2>
<p>Let's take a look at AMC's financial health, which is crucial for understanding its long-term viability. The data reveals several areas that warrant careful attention from investors.</p>
<p>A significant concern is the negative operating cash flow of <strong>-$42.90 million</strong> (TTM). This indicates that the company's core business operations are currently consuming more cash than they generate. While not uncommon for companies undergoing transformation or facing market challenges, sustained negative operating cash flow can put pressure on liquidity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Current Ratio of <strong>0.39x</strong> and Quick Ratio of <strong>0.29x</strong> both suggest potential liquidity issues. A Current Ratio below 1.0 means that current liabilities exceed current assets, potentially causing difficulties if the company's cash cycle lengthens or if unexpected expenses arise. These ratios signal that AMC might face challenges in meeting its short-term obligations if conditions worsen.</p>

<h3>AMC Entertainment (AMC) Operational Efficiency: Asset, Inventory, and Cash Cycle Insights</h3>
<p>Digging into AMC Entertainment Holdings' operational efficiency, we can see how effectively the company manages its assets and working capital. The Asset Turnover of <strong>0.59x</strong> suggests that AMC generates <strong>$0.59</strong> in revenue for every dollar of assets it holds. This indicates moderate efficiency in utilizing its asset base to drive sales.</p>
<p>When it comes to inventory, an Inventory Turnover of <strong>30.17x</strong> is quite strong. This means AMC efficiently sells and replaces its inventory roughly 30.2 times annually, translating to approximately 12.1 Days Inventory Outstanding. This is a positive sign of effective inventory management. Similarly, a Receivables Turnover of <strong>56.59x</strong> and 6.4 Days Sales Outstanding reflect excellent collections, indicating that customers pay their dues very quickly, which is great for cash flow.</p>
<p>However, the Working Capital Turnover of <strong>-6.10x</strong> is a concerning figure. This negative value, supported by the low Current Ratio of <strong>0.39x</strong>, points to potential issues in how the company uses its short-term assets to support sales, signaling possible liquidity concerns. The Cash Conversion Cycle, estimated at approximately <strong>~18.5 days (partial)</strong>, suggests it takes about 0.6 months to convert inventory and receivables into cash. This indicates relatively good cash management, despite the working capital challenges.</p>
<p>On the capital front, AMC Entertainment Holdings' Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) stands at <strong>-27.68%</strong>. This negative ROIC indicates that the company is currently not generating sufficient returns from its invested capital, highlighting an area that may need significant improvement to boost overall capital efficiency. Investors should definitely compare these figures with industry peers to assess AMC's competitive positioning more thoroughly.</p>

<h2>AMC Entertainment (AMC) Profitability &amp; Growth Trends: Margins and Revenue Deep Dive</h2>
<p>Let's unpack AMC's profitability and growth, as these are critical for any investment thesis. An analysis of the company's margin performance shows a mixed picture. AMC demonstrates some control over its production costs, evidenced by a gross margin of <strong>14.96%</strong>. Its core operations also generate a modest profit, reflected in the <strong>2.74%</strong> operating margin. An EBITDA margin of <strong>7.67%</strong> indicates that AMC is capable of generating cash flow from its operations before accounting for financing and tax strategies.</p>
<p>However, when we look at the bottom line, AMC held onto approximately <strong>-$13.160</strong> in net profit for every $1 of its revenue over the last twelve months. This negative profit margin is a significant concern. While the business's revenue is currently declining at a rate of <strong>-3.60%</strong> year-over-year, investors should monitor whether this trend can be reversed without further eroding already thin profit margins.</p>
<p>AMC's $373.10 million in EBITDA and $728.30 million in gross profit highlight its raw earning power. Yet, the -$640.60 million in net income reveals how challenging it is to convert that power into bottom-line results. From these indicators, it becomes clear that while the company has substantial revenue, it faces significant challenges in achieving overall profitability. There's a considerable gap between the gross and net margins (14.96% vs. -13.16%), which is likely due to high operating expenses, interest costs from its substantial debt, or taxes.</p><p>These are key areas investors need to watch closely. Moving forward, maintaining steady or improving margins will be absolutely critical. AMC needs to defend its pricing power and rigorously control operating costs, especially if revenue growth continues to moderate or decline.</p>

<h2>AMC Stock Dividends &amp; Shareholder Returns: What Investors Should Know</h2>
<p>When considering an investment, shareholder returns, particularly through dividends, are often a key factor for many. Let's look at AMC's approach to distributing profits back to its investors.</p>
<h3>AMC Dividend Policy: Reinvestment for Growth</h3>
<p>Based on the latest available data, AMC does not currently pay a regular dividend. This isn't necessarily a negative signal; it often suggests that the company is prioritizing reinvesting its earnings back into the business. This strategy can be aimed at funding growth initiatives, reducing debt, or strengthening its market position, all with the goal of increasing shareholder value over the long term through capital appreciation rather than immediate payouts.</p>

<h2>AMC Stock Technical Analysis: Price Trends, Momentum, and Trading Signals</h2>
<p>Alright, let's talk technicals! AMC is currently at <strong>$2.45</strong>, and the overall trend is bearish, showing signs of weakening. While the stock has seen a notable gain of <strong>+4.70%</strong> in just the last 15 days, a closer look at several technical indicators suggests we should approach this momentum with a healthy dose of caution. We need to understand what the charts are really telling us before making any moves.</p>
<h3>Trend Strength: Is AMC Still Bearish?</h3>
<p>Yes, AMC remains in a bearish trend. The price is currently trading below its key moving averages, which is a strong signal for caution. This indicates that the broader downtrend is still largely intact despite recent minor gains.</p>
<h4>What This Means for Traders?</h4>
<p>The 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at <strong>$2.28</strong> is now acting as an overhead resistance level. As long as the stock price stays below this mark, the bearish trend is likely to persist. A rejection from this average could very well lead to a re-test of recent lows, so keep a sharp eye on this level.</p>
<h3>Momentum Check: RSI and MACD Insights for AMC</h3>
<p>Let's check the pulse of the stock's momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at <strong>63.9</strong>, which places it firmly in a neutral zone. This means it's neither extremely overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively balanced momentum. However, the MACD histogram is positive, which actually confirms that some upward momentum is still in play, even if the overall trend is bearish.</p>
<h4>Trading Strategy:</h4>
<p>This neutral RSI reading, combined with a positive MACD histogram, offers some flexibility. What we need to watch for is a decisive MACD crossover or a clear break of a key support or resistance level. These will be the next directional clues for AMC.</p>
<h3>Bollinger Bands: AMC Stock's Volatility &amp; Key Levels</h3>
<p>Looking at the Bollinger Bands, AMC stock is currently trading comfortably in the upper half of its bands, specifically between the 20-day SMA and the upper band. This can be interpreted as a sign of underlying strength, suggesting that recent buying pressure has pushed the price higher within its typical volatility range.</p>
<h4>Key Levels to Watch:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resistance:</strong> Keep an eye on <strong>$2.66</strong>, which represents a recent high. A clear breakout above this level, especially with strong volume, could signal a push for AMC to move higher.</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> The 20-day SMA at <strong>$2.28</strong> is a critical support level. If the stock breaks below this, we should expect a test of <strong>$2.05</strong>, which is a significant near-term support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Volume Trends: Decoding AMC's Trading Activity</h3>
<p>While AMC has seen a recent price increase, it's crucial to examine the trading volume behind that move. Unfortunately, trading volume has been declining and is currently below its 20-day average. This is often considered a red flag when assessing the sustainability of a rally.</p>
<h4>What's the Concern?</h4>
<p>Rallies on low volume are frequently prone to sharp reversals. If we don't see a significant surge in buying interest to confirm the upward move, a pullback becomes more likely. For a truly convincing breakout, we'd want to see strong, increasing volume alongside the price appreciation.</p>
<h3>Support &amp; Resistance: Your AMC Trading Plan</h3>
<p>Based on the technical signals, here's a potential trading plan for AMC:</p>
<h4>Trading Plan:</h4>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>If AMC holds above $2.28:</strong> The bullish momentum in the short-term could continue, with the next target at <strong>$2.66</strong>.</li>
<li>⚠️ <strong>If it breaks below $2.28:</strong> Expect a dip toward <strong>$2.05</strong>. This would signal a weakening of the recent upward trend.</li>
<li>🛑 <strong>A drop below $2.05:</strong> This could trigger a deeper correction, potentially bringing the stock towards the 200-day SMA, currently at <strong>$2.91</strong> (though the current price is below the 200-day SMA, a deeper correction would be <em>further below</em> it).</li>
</ul>
<h3>AMC Stock Final Verdict: Buy, Hold, or Sell?</h3>
<p>Bringing it all together, here's my take for different types of investors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-Term Traders:</strong> The recent positive trend looks like it might be running out of steam. It's best to maintain a neutral stance until a clearer signal emerges, either from a decisive MACD crossover or a significant increase in volume.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investors:</strong> The long-term uptrend remains valid as long as the price stays above the 200-day SMA at <strong>$2.91</strong>. A pullback to the 50-day SMA area around <strong>$2.53</strong> could present a safer buying opportunity, offering a better entry point with a more favorable risk/reward profile.</li>
<li><strong>New Buyers:</strong> It would be wise to avoid chasing this current rally. Instead, wait for either a confirmed breakout above <strong>$2.66</strong> with strong, convincing volume, or a pullback to the <strong>$2.28</strong> area. These entry points would offer a better risk/reward balance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> The technical indicators suggest that AMC's recent rally might be losing momentum in the short term. While the long-term trend could still be seen as bullish by some, a correction seems plausible before the next major move. Trade carefully, always wait for confirmation at key levels, and consider checking <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance for AMC's latest charts and data</a>.</p>

<h2>AMC Stock Price Statistics: Volatility and Moving Averages</h2>
<p>Let's dive into some key price statistics that give us insight into AMC's behavior and risk. Looking at the price range over the past year, the stock has experienced a high of <strong>$5.56</strong> and a low of <strong>$2.05</strong>. This wide gap tells us that the stock has gone through significant fluctuations, likely influenced by market sentiment, company-specific news, or broader industry trends. It's been a volatile ride, to say the least.</p>
<p>Currently, the 50-day moving average stands at <strong>$2.66</strong>, which is below the 200-day moving average of <strong>$2.92</strong>. This configuration, where the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term one, often signals a short-term pullback or a consolidation phase. For technical traders, this setup is a critical indicator for momentum and overall trend direction.</p>
<p>With a Beta of <strong>0.75x</strong>, AMC stock tends to be less volatile than the broader market, moving about 25% less on average. However, this lower market sensitivity is paired with a high 30-day annualized volatility of <strong>47.2%</strong>. This combination indicates that while AMC might not swing as wildly <em>with</em> the market, it still sees frequent and significant price changes based on its own internal dynamics or sector-specific news. For investors, this implies potential for gains, but also higher downside risk when considering position sizing or entry timing, especially if you're balancing stability with growth exposure in your portfolio.

<h2>AMC Stock Short Selling Insights: Bearish Sentiment &amp; Short Squeeze Potential</h2>
<p>Understanding short interest can give us a glimpse into market sentiment, specifically how many investors are betting against a stock. Currently, there's <strong>48 million</strong> shares of AMC sold short. The short ratio, or "days to cover," stands at <strong>1.9x</strong>. This means that at the stock's recent average trading volume, it would take roughly two days for all short positions to be covered. A low days-to-cover figure like this generally suggests that short sellers do not have significant control over the stock's price, and the risk of a prolonged "short squeeze" (where a rapid price increase forces short sellers to buy back shares, further driving up the price) is relatively low.</p>
<p>With <strong>9.49%</strong> of the public float sold short, a moderate percentage of the stock is being shorted. This indicates some bearish sentiment among investors, but it's not at an extreme level that would typically trigger major alarm bells. This level has also remained relatively stable compared to last month's value of <strong>49 million</strong> shares shorted, suggesting no dramatic shift in bearish sentiment. While the short interest isn't extreme, investors should always be aware of potential volatility spikes. News events, especially positive ones, could still force some short sellers to cover their positions, leading to temporary price increases.</p>

<h2>AMC Stock Risk Analysis: Volatility and Downside Potential</h2>
<p>Every investment comes with risks, and for AMC, these are particularly pronounced. A thorough risk analysis is essential for any potential investor. AMC's risk profile reveals notably high volatility, with an annualized volatility of <strong>116.7%</strong>. This figure signals a very high investment risk, indicating that the stock's price can swing dramatically in either direction.</p>
<p>The Sharpe ratio of <strong>0.13x</strong> suggests mixed risk-adjusted returns. A low Sharpe ratio implies that the returns generated might not adequately compensate for the level of risk taken. Furthermore, the maximum drawdown of <strong>-99.67%</strong> is a stark reminder of the significant downside risk during adverse market conditions; it means the stock has experienced nearly a complete loss from its peak at some point.</p>
<p>The Value at Risk (VaR) at a 5% confidence level shows a potential loss of <strong>-6.50%</strong> in the worst 5% of scenarios over a given period. This quantifies the potential loss an investor could face under unfavorable market movements. The Sortino ratio of <strong>0.26x</strong>, which focuses specifically on downside risk, provides additional insight into risk-adjusted performance, highlighting how effectively the company generates returns relative to negative volatility. Investors must carefully weigh these risk metrics against their personal risk tolerance and investment objectives.</p>

<h2>AMC Stock Sentiment Analysis: News, Analysts, and Options Insights</h2>
<p>Market sentiment can heavily influence a stock's short-term movements. For AMC, the current market sentiment  a cautiously positive outlook, with a composite sentiment score of <strong>0.27x</strong> and a confidence level of <strong>43.9%</strong>. This overall positive sentiment is derived from various data sources, including recent news coverage, analyst recommendations, and activity in the options market.</p>
<p>Breaking down the sentiment components gives us a clearer picture: News analysis shows a Neutral sentiment (<strong>0.10x</strong>), indicating that recent headlines aren't overwhelmingly positive or negative. Analyst consensus also registers as Neutral (<strong>0.00x</strong>), suggesting a lack of strong conviction from professional analysts for either a buy or sell rating. However, the options market sentiment reflects a Positive outlook (<strong>0.94x</strong>), which could indicate that options traders are positioning for potential upward price movement.</p>
<p>These sentiment indicators are valuable, but they should always be considered alongside a thorough fundamental and technical analysis for a truly comprehensive investment perspective. They offer a pulse on how the broader market is feeling about AMC right now.</p>

<h2>AMC Entertainment (AMC) Peer Comparison: Valuations, Growth, and Profitability</h2>
<p>To truly understand AMC's position, it's helpful to compare it against its industry peers. Let's look at how AMC stacks up against Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (MSGS), Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (CNK), and Sphere Entertainment Co. (SPHR).</p>
<p>With a market cap of <strong>$1.26 billion</strong>, AMC is currently the smallest among these players. MSGS leads with <strong>$5.49 billion</strong>, followed by CNK at <strong>$3.22 billion</strong>, and SPHR at <strong>$3.05 billion</strong>. When it comes to earnings, AMC, like SPHR, is currently reporting losses, making traditional P/E ratio analysis challenging. MSGS, on the other hand, trades at a high P/E of <strong>142.52</strong>, while CNK has a more moderate <strong>24.89</strong>. The negative P/E ratios for AMC and SPHR reflect their current unprofitability.</p>
<p>Revenue growth tells another story: AMC saw a decline of <strong>-3.60%</strong>, while MSGS also experienced a drop of <strong>-26.00%</strong>. CNK's revenue decreased by <strong>-7.00%</strong>, but SPHR bucked the trend with strong momentum, showing <strong>15.20%</strong> revenue growth. Profitability remains a challenge for AMC, with a net margin of <strong>-13.16%</strong>. MSGS also faces losses at <strong>-2.31%</strong>, and SPHR shows significant losses at <strong>-27.40%</strong>. CNK stands out as the only profitable peer with a net margin of <strong>4.93%</strong>.</p>
<p>Regarding dividends, policies vary significantly. CNK offers a dividend yield of <strong>1.31%</strong>, rewarding shareholders with payouts. In contrast, AMC, MSGS, and SPHR currently reinvest all cash back into their businesses for growth rather than distributing dividends.</p>

<h2>AMC Insider Transactions: A Look at Recent Activity</h2>
<p>Insider activity can sometimes provide clues about a company's health, as those closest to the business have the most information. Over the last three months, AMC has seen <strong>78 insider transactions</strong>. It's important to note that a significant portion of these, <strong>46 transactions</strong>, were identified as stock awards or tax-related dispositions. These types of transactions are typically compensation-related or for tax planning, rather than discretionary market buys or sells by insiders betting on the stock's future direction.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were <strong>8 option exercises</strong>. Option exercises can signal confidence in future price appreciation, as insiders convert their options into shares, but they can also be part of routine portfolio management. A limiting factor in analyzing these transactions is that price data was only available for <strong>41%</strong> of the transactions, with estimates used where possible. This restricts a detailed valuation analysis of each specific trade, though the overall share volume patterns remain informative.</p>
<p>The recent insider activity appears to consist primarily of compensation-related transactions rather than significant discretionary market moves. This mixed activity pattern is quite typical for established companies where insiders balance personal financial planning with maintaining confidence in the business fundamentals.</p>

<h3>How volatile is AMC stock?</h3>

<h3>What is AMC's P/E ratio and what does it mean?</h3>
