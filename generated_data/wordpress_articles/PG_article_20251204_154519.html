<p>Hey there, fellow investor! If you're looking at <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PG" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG)</a>, you're eyeing a true titan in the Household &amp; Personal Products industry. With a hefty market cap of <strong>343.37 billion</strong>, PG is a name almost everyone recognizes. But here's the burning question: Does its current stock price truly reflect its value, and is it poised for future success?</p>
<p>Right now, PG is trading at <strong>$146.71</strong> (as of December 2025), and it's showing some bearish signals. However, don't let that deter you immediately. Analysts are pretty optimistic, with a 1-year price target suggesting a potential <strong>+14.5% upside</strong>. Yet, it's worth noting the <strong>14.3% annualized volatility</strong>, which means you can expect some noticeable price swings.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Procter &amp; Gamble presents a nuanced picture. It boasts impressive profitability with a <strong>19.74% profit margin</strong>, thanks to its strong brand portfolio. However, it's operating in a highly competitive sector and carries a significant debt load of <strong>35.95 billion</strong>. So, is PG the right fit for your portfolio? Let's dive into the details to help you make an informed decision.</p>
<h2>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG) Stock Analysis &amp; Price Forecast: December 2025 Insight</h2>
<h3>Quick Snapshot: Is PG Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold Right Now?</h3>
<p>As of December 2025, PG stock is trading at <strong>$146.71</strong>. The technical indicators are pointing to a bearish pattern, as the price is currently below both its 50-day (<strong>$148.76</strong>) and 200-day (<strong>$154.38</strong>) moving averages. This suggests that while there might have been recent attempts at momentum, the overall trend is weak.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a neutral <strong>48.9</strong>, meaning the stock isn't overbought or oversold. However, the MACD indicator hints at a bearish short-term trend, indicating potential minor pullbacks before any significant upward movement. Over the past year, PG has traded between <strong>$142.51 and $179.99</strong>, which places the current price near the lower end of this range. This could imply that significant downside might be limited unless a major catalyst emerges.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, analysts project a <strong>1-year target of $168.04</strong>, representing a potential <strong>+14.5% upside</strong>, with a consensus target of <strong>$169.05 (+15.2%)</strong>. What's more, with <strong>70.20% institutional ownership</strong> and a very low short interest of <strong>0.79%</strong>, it seems major investors are largely betting on PG's long-term stability rather than a decline. Here's a quick summary:</p>

<h2>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG) Valuation: A Deep Dive</h2>
<p>While The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG) is clearly a dominant force in its industry with a market cap of <strong>343.37 billion</strong>, its enterprise value stands even higher at <strong>368.15 billion</strong>. This difference is largely due to the <strong>24.78 billion</strong> in debt that adds to its overall value. Investors generally show confidence in PG's future earnings, but it's always wise to keep that significant debt load in mind, especially in the current interest rate environment.</p>
<p>The valuation ratios for PG tell a compelling story. Trading at <strong>4.34x revenue</strong> and <strong>14.91x EBITDA</strong>, the company commands a premium compared to many of its peers. This premium is a reflection of PG's strong market position, its iconic brand assets, and its consistent profitability. However, paying a premium also means the stock may have less room for error if operational performance falters.</p>
<p>The upcoming earnings report on <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>, will be a crucial event. It will show whether PG's businesses can continue to grow into this valuation. Additionally, the <strong>October 24, 2025</strong> ex-dividend date serves as a reminder that PG consistently rewards its shareholders, even as it invests for future growth. Essentially, when you invest in PG, you're paying for quality and stability, but that quality doesn't come cheap.</p>

<h2>PG Share Statistics: Insider, Institutional, and Short Interest Insights</h2>
<p>When we look at PG's share statistics, we find that nearly all of the company's <strong>2 billion</strong> shares are publicly available as float. This high float means investors can typically trade the stock without causing significant price volatility due to supply constraints. However, it's always a point to consider that the company could issue more shares, potentially diluting the value of existing stock.</p>
<p>Interestingly, executives and major shareholders hold a very small portion of the company, at just <strong>0.07%</strong>. This could be interpreted as them having less "skin in the game" if the company faces challenges. On the flip side, the level of institutional ownership is quite significant, coming in at a robust <strong>70.20%</strong>. This strong institutional backing often provides a degree of stability and confidence in the stock, as large funds have done their due diligence.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about short interest. With <strong>18 million</strong> shares currently shorted, representing just <strong>0.79%</strong> of the float, it suggests that bearish bets against PG are relatively low. This indicates that most investors aren't expressing significant concern about the company's prospects. A low short interest level like this can sometimes discourage a "short squeeze" scenario, where bears are forced to buy back shares, driving prices up. Investors should still watch for any changes in this metric, as a sharp increase could signal growing doubts among a segment of the market.</p>

<h2>Key Valuation Metrics for PG Stock: P/E, Price/Sales, and EV Ratios</h2>
<p>Understanding PG's valuation metrics helps us assess its current market positioning. The Trailing P/E ratio, which looks at past earnings, stands at <strong>21.42x</strong>, while the Forward P/E, based on expected future earnings, is <strong>19.77x</strong>. This slight improvement in the forward P/E suggests that analysts anticipate modest earnings growth, making the stock appear reasonably valued for a company of its stature.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PG's Price/Sales ratio of <strong>4.04x</strong> and Price/Book ratio of <strong>6.53x</strong> indicate that the company trades at multiples that warrant attention. These figures are crucial for gaining insight into how the market values PG's revenue and assets, especially when compared to industry averages and historical trends. For a deeper dive into their financial disclosures, you can check out their latest <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=PG" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SEC filings</a>.</p>
<p>From an enterprise value perspective, PG’s EV/Revenue ratio of <strong>4.34x</strong> indicates a reasonable valuation when considering its top-line performance. However, its EV/EBITDA multiple of <strong>14.91x</strong> suggests a potentially stretched valuation. These enterprise value metrics, combined with the other ratios, offer a comprehensive view of how the market perceives PG's worth, blending both its operational earnings and its overall capital structure.</p>

<h2>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG) Financial Health Check: Debt, Liquidity, and Cash Flow</h2>
<p>PG's financial data presents a mix of significant strengths and areas that warrant investor attention. Its Return on Equity (ROE) of <strong>31.90%</strong> and Return on Assets (ROA) of <strong>10.75%</strong> are quite impressive. These figures demonstrate a highly efficient use of capital, often characteristic of well-managed, fast-growing firms, showcasing how effectively PG generates profits from its shareholder equity and total assets.</p>
<p>The company's Debt/Equity ratio stands at <strong>0.67x</strong>. While PG carries <strong>35.95 billion</strong> in total debt, it also holds <strong>11.17 billion</strong> in cash. This ratio suggests that PG has taken on a manageable debt load to fuel its operations and strategic growth initiatives. What's particularly strong is its ability to generate <strong>18.92 billion</strong> in operating cash flow (TTM). This consistent cash generation from its core business is a significant strength, proving its operational solidity.</p>
<p>However, some liquidity metrics suggest potential challenges. The Current Ratio of <strong>0.71x</strong> and Quick Ratio of <strong>0.47x</strong> are both below 1.0. This indicates that PG might face short-term liquidity issues if its cash cycle lengthens or if it needs to cover immediate liabilities. Despite these points, PG's <strong>12.20 billion</strong> in levered free cash flow suggests it can still generate substantial cash for shareholders, even after meeting all its financial obligations and debt servicing.</p>

<h2>PG's Financial Efficiency: Asset Turnover, Inventory, and Cash Conversion Cycle Analysis</h2>
<p>When we look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company's financial efficiency, we see a mixed bag. The Asset Turnover ratio of <strong>0.68x</strong> suggests that PG generates <strong>$0.68</strong> in revenue for every dollar of assets it holds. This indicates moderate efficiency in utilizing its asset base to produce sales, which is a key area for potential improvement.</p>
<p>The Inventory Turnover of <strong>5.45x</strong> means P&amp;G sells and replaces its inventory roughly 5.5 times annually. This translates to approximately <strong>67.0 Days Inventory Outstanding</strong>, indicating a somewhat slower pace of inventory movement. On a more positive note, the Receivables Turnover of <strong>13.73x</strong> and <strong>26.6 Days Sales Outstanding</strong> reflect excellent collections efficiency, meaning customers are paying their bills very quickly.</p>
<p>However, the Working Capital Turnover of <strong>-7.96x</strong> raises some concerns. This negative figure, coupled with a Current Ratio of <strong>0.71x</strong>, signals potential issues with how short-term assets are used to support sales and hints at possible liquidity challenges. The Cash Conversion Cycle, estimated at approximately <strong>93.6 days (partial)</strong>, suggests it takes about 3.1 months for P&amp;G to convert its inventory and receivables into cash. This extended cycle could put a strain on working capital.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, PG's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of <strong>19.21%</strong> is quite strong. This figure shows how effectively P&amp;G generates returns from the capital it has invested in its operations, highlighting robust capital efficiency. Overall, to further boost profitability, P&amp;G might need to focus on achieving higher asset utilization. As always, comparing these figures with industry peers is essential to fully assess its competitive positioning.</p>

<h2>PG Profitability &amp; Growth: Margins, Revenue, and Earnings Performance</h2>
<p>An in-depth look at PG's margin performance reveals that the company has a solid grip on its costs and pricing strategies. The gross margin, standing at a healthy <strong>51.28%</strong>, clearly shows PG's success in controlling its production costs. Furthermore, the <strong>27.58% operating margin</strong> reflects strong profitability from its core business operations, indicating efficient management of day-to-day expenses.</p>
<p>The EBITDA margin of <strong>29.11%</strong> is another positive sign, demonstrating PG's capability to generate robust cash flow from its operations before accounting for financing and tax strategies. All things considered, PG manages to retain approximately <strong>19.74 cents</strong> in net profit for every dollar of revenue it generated over the last twelve months. While the business's revenue is growing at an aggressive rate of <strong>3.00%</strong> year-over-year, investors should closely monitor whether this pace can be sustained without eroding those impressive profit margins.</p>
<p>PG's raw earning power is evident with <strong>24.72 billion</strong> in EBITDA and <strong>43.55 billion</strong> in gross profit. More importantly, its net income of <strong>16.47 billion</strong> reveals how effectively it converts that earning power into bottom-line results for shareholders. The company appears to strike a good balance between pursuing growth and maintaining strong profitability, with earnings growth at <strong>21.40%</strong> year-over-year.</p>
<p>However, despite healthy gross margins, there's a significant spread between the company's gross and net margins (<strong>51.28% vs. 19.74%</strong>). This gap likely stems from substantial operating expenses, interest costs, or taxes, which are key areas for investors to scrutinize. Moving forward, maintaining and even improving these margins will be critical. PG needs to defend its pricing power and keep a tight control on operating costs to sustain profitability, especially if revenue growth begins to moderate.</p>

<h2>PG Dividends &amp; Shareholder Returns: Yield, Payout, and Ex-Dividend Dates</h2>
<h3>Dividend Summary &amp; Investor Implications</h3>
<p>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company currently offers an attractive <strong>$4.23 annual dividend per share</strong>. This translates into a dividend yield of <strong>2.88%</strong>, meaning for every <strong>$100</strong> invested, shareholders receive <strong>$4.23</strong> in dividends annually. What's particularly noteworthy for income-focused investors is that this yield is currently above its 5-year average of <strong>2.43%</strong>, making it more appealing today compared to its recent historical performance. You can often find the latest dividend information on financial platforms like <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PG" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a>.</p>
<h3>Key Observations &amp; Analysis:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The payout ratio of <strong>60.24%</strong> is healthy. This indicates that PG uses only about 60% of its earnings to fund its dividends, leaving ample room for potential future increases or reinvestment back into the business for growth initiatives.</li>
<li>While the trailing yield is noted as <strong>0.03%</strong> with a trailing dividend rate of <strong>$4.13</strong>, this discrepancy suggests a need to verify the most recent dividend announcements for consistency, as the annual rate is more indicative of a steady payout.</li>
<li>For investors looking to receive the next dividend, it's crucial to own the stock before the upcoming ex-dividend date of <strong>October 24, 2025</strong>.</li>
<li>The last stock split (2:1 in 2004) is quite old and likely has little direct relevance to the company's current valuation or investment thesis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Investor Takeaway:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Income Investors:</strong> The dividend appears sustainable given the healthy payout ratio. However, it's always wise to monitor PG's earnings and cash flow to ensure the payout remains well-supported in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Investors:</strong> PG strikes a good balance between returning capital to shareholders and reinvesting for growth. This makes it an appealing option for those pursuing a "growth and income" investment strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Watch For:</strong> Keep an eye out for any announcements of dividend hikes, which could bring the yield closer to or above its historical average. Also, significant stock price movements would naturally alter the effective dividend yield.</li>

<h2>PG Technical Analysis: Decoding Price Trends, Momentum, and Key Levels</h2>
<p>Currently, PG's stock price sits at <strong>$146.71</strong>, and the overall trend is unmistakably bearish, showing signs of continued weakening. The stock has experienced downward pressure, losing <strong>-0.19%</strong> in just the last 15 days. For traders and investors, the big question is whether this signals a buying opportunity or a warning of deeper declines. Let's break down the crucial technical levels.</p>
<h3>Trend Strength – Still Bearish</h3>
<p>PG is firmly entrenched in a bearish trend, trading consistently below its key moving averages. This configuration typically signals caution for those tracking market trends. The price action indicates that the bears are currently in control, pushing the stock lower.</p>
<h4>What This Means for Traders?</h4>
<p>The <strong>20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $148.01</strong> is currently acting as a significant overhead resistance level. As long as PG's price remains below this point, the bearish trend is likely to persist. A rejection from this average could very well lead to a re-test of recent lows, presenting further downside risk for short-term traders.</p>
<h3>Momentum Check – Is Momentum Fading?</h3>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for PG is at <strong>48.9</strong>, placing it squarely in a neutral zone. This indicates a balanced momentum, meaning the stock is neither overbought nor oversold at this precise moment. However, when we look at the MACD histogram, it's showing negative values, suggesting that any recent upward momentum is beginning to fade. This could imply a period of consolidation or further downside before a clear new trend emerges.</p>
<h4>Trading Strategy:</h4>
<p>Given the neutral RSI reading, traders have some flexibility. The best approach might be to watch for a decisive MACD crossover, which could signal a change in short-term trend, or a clear break of a key support or resistance level. These signals would provide a stronger directional clue for your next move.</p>
<h3>Bollinger Bands – Testing Key Levels</h3>
<p>Currently, PG's stock price is testing support near the <strong>lower Bollinger Band at $145.08</strong>. A successful bounce from this level would be a bullish indicator, suggesting that the downside might be limited for now. Conversely, a decisive break below this lower band would be a strong bearish signal, potentially opening the door for further price declines.</p>
<h3>Key Levels to Watch:</h3>
<p>Understanding these critical price points can help frame your trading decisions. Keep these levels firmly on your radar:</p>
<h4>Resistance:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>$151.50</strong> (Recent High): A strong breakout above this level, especially with robust volume, could signal a renewed bullish push for PG.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Support:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>$148.01</strong> (20-day SMA): If the price breaks below this crucial moving average, expect it to test the next significant support at <strong>$145.08</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Volume Trends – Checking for Conviction</h3>
<p>Trading volume for PG is currently near its recent average. This provides neutral confirmation of the current price action. In other words, there isn't a strong surge in buying or selling pressure indicated by volume alone, which often accompanies a significant trend reversal or continuation. We'd ideally want to see higher volume on a breakout or breakdown for stronger conviction. You can often see historical volume data on platforms like <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/pg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MarketWatch</a>.</p>
<h3>Support &amp; Resistance – The Trading Plan</h3>
<p>Here’s a practical trading plan based on the observed support and resistance levels:</p>
<h4>Trading Plan:</h4>
<ul>
<li>✅ If PG holds above <strong>$148.01</strong>: The bullish trend may attempt to continue, with the next target being <strong>$151.50</strong>.</li>
<li>⚠️ If it breaks below <strong>$148.01</strong>: Expect a potential dip toward the <strong>$145.08</strong> level, which is the lower Bollinger Band.</li>
<li>🛑 A drop below <strong>$145.08</strong>: This could trigger a deeper correction, potentially pushing the price down towards the 200-day SMA at <strong>$154.38</strong> (though the current price is already below it, a re-test from a lower point would confirm weakness).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Verdict – Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell?</h3>
<p>The technical indicators suggest that the recent rally in PG stock might be losing steam in the short term. While the long-term trend still appears bullish, a correction seems plausible before the next significant move. Here's what this means for different types of investors:</p>
<h4>Short-Term Traders:</h4>
<p>The trend is showing positive signs but keep a close watch for any indications of exhaustion. A neutral stance might be the most prudent approach until a clearer signal emerges from either the MACD or volume analysis. Patience is key here.</p>
<h4>Long-Term Investors:</h4>
<p>For those with a longer time horizon, the long-term uptrend for PG remains valid as long as the price holds above the 200-day SMA, which is currently at <strong>$154.38</strong>. A pullback towards the 50-day SMA area (<strong>$148.76</strong>) could actually present a safer and more attractive buying opportunity for accumulating shares.</p>
<h4>New Buyers:</h4>
<p>If you're considering initiating a new position, it's generally wise to avoid chasing the rally at current levels. Instead, wait for either a confirmed breakout above <strong>$151.50</strong> with strong, convincing volume, or a more favorable pullback to the <strong>$148.01</strong> area. These entry points would offer a better risk/reward profile.</p>
<h4>Bottom Line:</h4>
<p>The technical picture for PG suggests that the current upward momentum may be running out of steam in the short term. While the overarching long-term trend still leans bullish, a temporary correction appears plausible before the stock makes its next significant move. Exercise caution and wait for clear confirmation at these key technical levels before committing capital.</p>

<h3>PG Stock Price Statistics: Volatility, Beta, and Moving Averages</h3>
<p>When we examine PG's price statistics over the past year, we see a 52-week high of <strong>$179.99</strong> and a low of <strong>$142.51</strong>. This moderate range indicates that the stock has experienced notable price swings, but perhaps not extreme volatility, over the last twelve months. Currently, the 50-day moving average stands at <strong>$149.63</strong>, which is slightly below the 200-day moving average of <strong>$158.90</strong>. This configuration often signals a short-term pullback or a consolidation phase, particularly for technical traders who rely on momentum and trend direction for their strategies.</p>
<p>With a Beta of <strong>0.38x</strong>, PG stock tends to be less volatile than the broader market. This means it generally moves about 62% less than the overall market, making it a relatively stable component in a portfolio. Coupled with a low 30-day annualized volatility of <strong>14.3%</strong>, it's clear that while the stock does see price fluctuations, these are not typically as dramatic as those seen in higher-beta stocks. For investors, this lower volatility implies potential for more stable gains, but also less exposure to extreme downside risk. These indicators are crucial when you're deciding on position sizing or the optimal timing for entry, especially if you're aiming to balance stability with growth exposure in your portfolio.</p>

<h2>PG Quarterly Earnings Performance: Revenue, Net Income, and Growth Trends</h2>
<p>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company's recent quarterly performance provides a clear picture of its operational health and growth trajectory. In its latest reported quarter (2025-Q3), PG posted revenue of <strong>22.39 billion</strong> and a net income of <strong>4.75 billion</strong>. These figures demonstrate its continued ability to generate substantial sales and convert them into bottom-line profits.</p>
<p>From a growth perspective, the quarter-over-quarter revenue change was a solid <strong>+7.2%</strong>. This indicates healthy sequential momentum in sales. More broadly, the year-over-year revenue growth stands at <strong>+3.0%</strong>, showing consistent, albeit moderate, expansion in its top line compared to the same period last year. These growth metrics are important for assessing the company's ability to scale and compete in its diverse markets.</p>

<h3>Upcoming Earnings Report for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG)</h3>
<p>For investors keeping a close eye on PG, the next earnings report is a significant event. It's scheduled for <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>. The earnings call will follow on the same day at <strong>07:00 PM ET</strong>, providing an opportunity for management to discuss the results and outlook. Mark your calendars!</p>
<h2>PG Short Selling Insights: Shares Short, Ratio, and Sentiment</h2>
<p>When it comes to short selling activity, PG currently has <strong>18 million</strong> shares worth of short interest. The short ratio, often referred to as "days to cover," stands at <strong>2.2x</strong>. What this means is that, at the stock's recent average daily trading volume, it would take approximately 2 days for all short positions to be covered. This relatively low figure suggests that short sellers don't currently exert significant control over PG's price, and the risk of a prolonged "short squeeze" (where a rapid increase in price forces shorts to buy back, further driving up the price) is quite low.</p>
<p>Furthermore, only <strong>0.79%</strong> of the public float is sold short. This very low percentage indicates a general lack of bearish sentiment among investors, suggesting that most market participants aren't actively betting against the company. It's interesting to note that this level has slightly increased from <strong>17 million</strong> shares in the prior month, suggesting a minor shift in bearish sentiment, but it remains at a very low overall level. When short interest is low, it often contributes to a more confident market sentiment and reduces the risks of sudden price swings driven by short-covering activities.</p>

<h2>PG Stock Risk Analysis: Volatility, Drawdown, and VaR</h2>
<p>A thorough risk analysis of PG reveals a profile of moderate investment risk. The stock's annualized volatility of <strong>15.5%</strong> indicates a manageable degree of price fluctuations, which is important for investors assessing potential market swings. This figure helps put the day-to-day movements into perspective.</p>
<p>The Sharpe ratio, at <strong>0.34x</strong>, suggests mixed risk-adjusted returns. While it's positive, indicating some reward for the risk taken, it highlights that the returns aren't exceptionally high when compared to the volatility experienced. Meanwhile, the maximum drawdown of <strong>-23.77%</strong> reveals the largest percentage drop from a peak to a trough during a specific period. This metric points to a moderate downside risk during adverse market conditions, giving investors a sense of the potential capital at risk.</p>
<p>For more specific risk quantification, the Value at Risk (VaR) at a 5% confidence level shows a potential loss of <strong>-1.37%</strong> in the worst 5% of scenarios over a given period. This gives a probabilistic estimate of potential losses. Additionally, the Sortino ratio of <strong>0.44x</strong> is valuable because it focuses specifically on downside risk, only penalizing returns for volatility below a target return. This provides a more refined insight into risk-adjusted performance from a negative volatility perspective.</p>
<p>Other statistical measures like Skewness (<strong>0.24x</strong>) and Kurtosis (<strong>18.61x</strong>) provide further detail on the distribution of returns, indicating how symmetrical or "tailed" the returns are. Ultimately, investors should carefully consider these risk metrics in conjunction with their own risk tolerance and broader investment objectives. Understanding these numbers is crucial for making informed decisions about including PG in your portfolio.</p>

<h2>PG Peer Comparison: How The Procter &amp; Gamble Stacks Up Against Competitors</h2>
<p>When we compare The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG) to its key industry peers like Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), and Church &amp; Dwight (CHD), PG truly stands out, especially due to its sheer size. With a market cap of <strong>$343.37B</strong>, PG significantly dwarfs CL (<strong>$63.20B</strong>), KMB (<strong>$35.22B</strong>), and CHD (<strong>$20.44B</strong>), highlighting its dominant position in the Household &amp; Personal Products sector.</p>
<p>Looking at valuation, PG’s P/E ratio of <strong>21.42x</strong> represents a moderate valuation. In contrast, KMB trades at a lower multiple of <strong>17.96x</strong>, which often reflects mature or slower-growth businesses. When it comes to revenue growth, PG shows a modest <strong>3.0%</strong> expansion, which is respectable in a defensive sector. However, PG’s robust <strong>19.74%</strong> net margin truly demonstrates its strong profitability, significantly outpacing CL (<strong>14.47%</strong>) and KMB (<strong>9.98%</strong>).</p>
<p>PG also boasts an exceptional Return on Equity (ROE) of <strong>31.90%</strong>, indicating highly efficient use of shareholder equity to generate profits. In terms of leverage, PG maintains a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of <strong>67.12</strong>. Meanwhile, peers like CL (<strong>680</strong>) and KMB (<strong>500</strong>) show substantially higher leverage, which can be a point of concern for some investors. Finally, PG offers a solid dividend yield of <strong>2.88%</strong>, providing a reliable income stream to shareholders, comparable to CL (<strong>2.66%</strong>) and a bit lower than KMB (<strong>4.75%</strong>).</p>

<h2>PG Insider Transactions: Recent Buys, Sells, and Awards</h2>
<p>Over the last three months, PG has seen a total of <strong>58 insider transactions</strong>. It's important to differentiate these: a significant portion, <strong>45</strong>, were related to stock awards or tax-related dispositions. These are often routine equity compensation activities and don't necessarily signal strong directional conviction about the company's prospects. Only <strong>19%</strong> of transactions had price data readily available, with estimates used where necessary.</p>
<p>Focusing on the discretionary open-market activity, we observed <strong>11 market sales</strong> compared to <strong>0 market purchases</strong>. This pattern suggests that insiders have been actively reducing their positions in the near term. While the limited price data restricts a detailed valuation analysis of these specific transactions, the volume patterns still provide valuable information. The predominance of award-related transactions means we shouldn't read too much into the "buy" side of the ledger, as these are typically grants rather than active market purchases. The trend leans towards selling in the open market by insiders.</p>
