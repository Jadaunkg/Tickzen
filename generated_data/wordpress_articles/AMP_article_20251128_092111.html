<h2>Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Stock Analysis: Navigating Current Trends &amp; Future Outlook</h2>

Let's dive into the most recent data and market insights to answer these questions for you.

<h3>AMP Stock: Key Insights for Today's Investor</h3>

As of today, <strong>November 28, 2025</strong>, AMP stock is trading at <strong>$453.47</strong>. What's immediately noticeable is that the stock is currently in a bearish trend, trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This signals a cautious short-term outlook.

Despite the recent technical weakness, analysts maintain an optimistic stance, projecting a 1-year price target of <strong>$532.18</strong>, which suggests a potential <strong>+17.4% upside</strong> from current levels. However, it's worth noting the stock's significant annualized volatility of <strong>23.8%</strong>. This indicates that while the upside potential is there, investors should be prepared for considerable price swings.

Ameriprise Financial's fundamental story presents a nuanced picture. On the one hand, the company is demonstrating solid revenue growth, up <strong>7.30% year-over-year</strong>. On the other hand, it faces intense competition within its sector, a constant pressure point for any asset management firm.

Currently, AMP's stock is trading at <strong>$453.47</strong>. Technical indicators are signaling a bearish pattern because the price is currently below both its 50-day (<strong>$463.96</strong>) and 200-day (<strong>$498.21</strong>) moving averages. This suggests a weakening momentum. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at <strong>36.2</strong> is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, while the MACD indicator points to a bullish short-term trend, potentially hinting at minor pullbacks before any significant upward moves.

Over the past year, AMP's stock has navigated a range between <strong>$396.14</strong> and <strong>$582.05</strong>. This range tells us that investor sentiment has been quite mixed, and the current price is trading roughly mid-range. This could imply that extreme price swings are less likely unless a major catalyst emerges. Analysts are projecting modest growth, with a 1-year target of <strong>$593.50 (+30.9%)</strong> and an average consensus target of <strong>$532.18 (+17.4%)</strong>. Furthermore, with an impressive <strong>89.20% institutional ownership</strong> and relatively low short interest at <strong>3.60%</strong>, it appears many large investors are banking on AMP's long-term success rather than anticipating a decline.

Ameriprise Financial, Inc., along with its various subsidiaries, operates as a comprehensive financial services provider, catering to individual and institutional clients across the United States and internationally. The company strategically divides its operations into three primary segments.

The <strong>Advice &amp; Wealth Management</strong> segment is where clients receive financial planning and advice. This segment offers a broad array of services including brokerage products, discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory accounts, mutual funds, insurance and annuities, and cash management solutions.

Next up is the <strong>Asset Management</strong> segment, which operates under the well-known Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand. This segment delivers investment management, advice, and products to a diverse client base, including retail, high net worth, and institutional clients.

This diversified structure allows Ameriprise to serve a wide range of client needs across their financial lifecycle.

<h2>AMP Stock Valuation: Market Cap, Enterprise Value &amp; Key Ratios</h2>

When we look at Ameriprise Financial's valuation, a few key metrics stand out. While the company boasts a market capitalization of <strong>$42.75 billion</strong>, its enterprise value (EV) comes in lower at <strong>$36.52 billion</strong>. This difference is a positive sign, reflecting a robust net cash position of approximately <strong>$6.23 billion</strong>. This substantial cash cushion provides the company with financial flexibility and a strong foundation for future investments.

The recent ex-dividend date of <strong>November 10, 2025</strong>, also serves as a reminder that Ameriprise Financial continues to reward its shareholders while simultaneously investing for long-term growth. It suggests that investors are paying for a quality operation, and quality often comes with a premium.

<h2>AMP Share Statistics: Float, Ownership &amp; Short Interest Insights</h2>

Understanding who owns a company's shares and how many are available for trading can offer crucial insights into its market dynamics and investor sentiment. Let's break down AMP's share statistics.

Nearly all of Ameriprise Financial's <strong>93 million</strong> shares are publicly available as float, meaning there isn't a significant amount of stock locked up. A high float typically allows investors to trade the stock without causing drastic price shifts. However, it's also a point to remember that the company could issue more shares, potentially diluting the value of existing stock in the future.

Interestingly, executives and major shareholders hold a very small portion of the company, at just <strong>0.19%</strong>. This might suggest they don't have substantial "skin in the game" if the company faces challenges. In contrast, institutional ownership is remarkably significant, standing at <strong>89.20%</strong>. This strong institutional backing often provides a degree of stability and confidence in the stock, as large funds typically conduct extensive due diligence before investing.

Now, let's consider the impact of short interest. With <strong>3 million</strong> shares currently shorted, representing <strong>3.60%</strong> of the float, there's a notable level of bearish sentiment present. Investors should monitor changes in this figure; a sharp increase could signal growing doubt among some market participants. Conversely, very low short interest during positive news periods might sometimes lessen the potential for a "short squeeze," where short sellers are forced to buy back shares, driving prices up.

Understanding a company's valuation metrics helps us gauge how the market perceives its worth relative to its earnings, sales, and assets. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) presents some interesting figures that warrant a closer look.

AMP's Trailing P/E ratio, based on past earnings, is <strong>12.47x</strong>, while its Forward P/E, which considers expected future earnings, stands at <strong>11.74x</strong>. This slight decrease in the forward P/E suggests that analysts anticipate a modest improvement in earnings or believe the stock is attractively valued. These figures indicate a potentially appealing valuation opportunity compared to some peers.

Meanwhile, the Price/Sales (TTM) ratio of <strong>$2.31</strong> and Price/Book (MRQ) ratio of <strong>$6.54</strong> demonstrate that the company is trading at multiples that demand attention. These metrics provide additional insight into AMP's market positioning relative to its revenue and tangible assets.

<h2>Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Financial Health &amp; Liquidity Analysis</h2>

Ameriprise Financial's financial health appears quite robust, highlighted by several key strengths that suggest a well-managed operation. The company's Return on Equity (ROE) of <strong>59.59%</strong> and Return on Assets (ROA) of <strong>2.22%</strong> are impressive, reflecting a highly efficient use of capital. These figures are often observed in firms that are effectively leveraging their assets and equity to generate profits.

The Debt/Equity ratio of <strong>0.54x</strong>, calculated with <strong>$3.50 billion</strong> in debt against <strong>$9.73 billion</strong> in cash, indicates that AMP has taken on a manageable debt load. This level of debt is often used strategically to fuel operations and growth without creating undue financial strain. Despite its debt, the company's ability to generate <strong>$6.04 billion</strong> in operating cash flow (TTM) is a significant strength, proving that its core business can consistently produce cash.

Furthermore, AMP's Current Ratio of <strong>2.43x</strong> and Quick Ratio of <strong>1.55x</strong> demonstrate a solid liquidity position. This means the company is well-equipped to cover its short-term liabilities with current assets. The <strong>$2.84 billion</strong> in levered free cash flow suggests that even after meeting all its financial obligations, Ameriprise Financial can still generate substantial cash for its shareholders. For investors, this financial profile paints a picture of a resilient and well-managed company, with low debt and strong liquidity providing a safety net and the flexibility for future investments, weathering economic downturns, or enhancing shareholder returns.

<h2>AMP Financial Efficiency: Asset Turnover &amp; ROIC Insights</h2>

Evaluating a company's financial efficiency helps us understand how effectively it uses its assets to generate revenue and profits. For Ameriprise Financial (AMP), the picture is mixed, with some areas of strength and others that might warrant closer attention.

AMP's Asset Turnover of <strong>0.10x</strong> suggests that it generates <strong>$0.10</strong> in revenue for every dollar of assets it holds. This indicates a lower efficiency in asset utilization, which could be an area for potential improvement to boost overall profitability. Meanwhile, the Receivables Turnover of <strong>1.28x</strong> and a Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) of <strong>285.2</strong> days reflect slower collections. This metric suggests that it takes the company a relatively long time to convert its credit sales into cash, an aspect that may require management's focus.

On a positive note, Ameriprise Financial's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) stands at an impressive <strong>33.92%</strong>. This figure signals strong capital efficiency, demonstrating how effectively the company generates returns from the capital it has invested in its operations. Overall, while AMP shows strong capital efficiency, it might benefit from higher asset utilization to further enhance its profitability. Investors should compare these figures with industry peers to fully assess AMP's competitive positioning.

<h2>AMP Profitability &amp; Growth: Margins and Revenue Drivers</h2>

The company demonstrates strong control over its production costs, evidenced by a gross margin of <strong>56.77%</strong>. Furthermore, it generates a healthy profit from its core operations, reflected in an operating margin of <strong>37.30%</strong>. While the EBITDA margin is not available, the overall picture suggests AMP is capable of generating strong cash flow from its operations before accounting for financing and tax strategies. All things considered, AMP manages to retain approximately <strong>$19.59</strong> in net profit for every <strong>$100</strong> of revenue over the last twelve months.

The business is also experiencing aggressive revenue growth, increasing by <strong>7.30% year-over-year</strong>. However, investors should closely monitor whether this pace can be sustained without eroding those impressive profit margins. AMP also reported <strong>$10.51 billion</strong> in gross profit and <strong>$3.63 billion</strong> in net income, showcasing its ability to convert raw earning power into bottom-line results. The company appears to be effectively balancing its pursuit of growth with the critical need to maintain profitability.

Despite healthy gross margins, there's a notable difference between the company's gross and net margins (<strong>56.77%</strong> vs. <strong>19.59%</strong>). This gap is likely due to operating expenses, interest costs, or taxes, which are key areas for investors to monitor. Moving forward, maintaining steady or improving margins will be crucial for AMP. The company needs to defend its pricing power and control operating costs, as this will help sustain profitability, especially if revenue growth rates normalize.

<h2>AMP Dividends &amp; Shareholder Returns: Yield, Payout, and Outlook</h2>

For income-focused investors, dividends are a key consideration. Let's examine Ameriprise Financial's dividend profile and what it means for shareholders.

<h3>AMP Dividend Summary and Investor Implications</h3>

Ameriprise Financial currently offers a <strong>$6.40 annual dividend per share</strong>, which translates to a dividend yield of <strong>1.41%</strong>. This means that for every $100 invested, shareholders would receive $1.41 in dividends annually. Interestingly, this current yield is slightly below its 5-year average of <strong>1.49%</strong>, which could suggest that the stock price has appreciated (thereby reducing the yield) or that dividend growth hasn't quite kept pace with historical trends.

<h3>Key Observations on AMP's Dividend Strategy</h3>

One of the most compelling aspects of AMP's dividend is its low and conservative payout ratio of <strong>16.95%</strong>. This indicates that the company uses only about 17% of its earnings to fund its dividends, leaving ample room for future increases or significant reinvestment back into the business for growth. The very low trailing dividend yield of <strong>0.01%</strong> might initially seem unusual, but it typically hints at a recent dividend initiation or perhaps a special, non-recurring payout in the past, warranting further checks for consistency in future reports.

<h3>Investor Takeaways: What AMP's Dividend Means for You</h3>
</em> <strong>For Income Investors:</strong> The modest yield and conservative payout ratio suggest that AMP's dividends are safe and sustainable, but they might not be the primary driver for investing. The focus here could be more on the potential for future dividend growth rather than a high immediate yield.
<em> <strong>For Growth Investors:</strong> The low payout ratio is a strong signal that a significant portion of earnings is being reinvested into the company. This strategy could fuel future price appreciation, making it attractive for those prioritizing capital gains.

<h3>What to Watch For in AMP's Dividend Future</h3>

Keep an eye out for any announcements of dividend hikes, which could potentially bring the yield closer to its historical average. Also, monitor any significant stock price changes, as these would naturally alter the dividend yield. Remember, to receive the next dividend, investors needed to own the stock before the ex-dividend date of <strong>November 10, 2025</strong>.

<h2>AMP Technical Analysis: Price Trends, Momentum &amp; Key Levels</h2>

Let's shift our focus to the technical side of AMP stock. The current price stands at <strong>$453.47</strong>, and the overall trend is bearish, with signs that it continues to weaken. The stock has experienced downward pressure, losing <strong>-2.47%</strong> in the last 15 days. Now, the critical question for traders and investors is whether this represents a buying opportunity or a warning of further declines. Let's break down the key technical levels.

<h3>AMP Technical Overview: Current Price and Trend</h3>

The current price of AMP is <strong>$453.47</strong>. The trend is bearish and continues to weaken, as indicated by the stock trading below key moving averages.

<h3>Trend Strength: Is AMP's Bearish Momentum Persisting?</h3>

AMP is firmly entrenched in a bearish trend, trading below its key moving averages. This situation signals caution for investors.

<h4>Implications for Traders: Navigating AMP's Trend</h4>

The <strong>20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $453.89</strong> is now acting as a critical overhead resistance level. As long as the price remains below this average, the bearish trend is likely to persist. A rejection from this level could potentially lead to a retesting of recent lows, emphasizing the importance of this resistance point.

<h3>Momentum Check: RSI and MACD for AMP Stock</h3>

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for AMP is currently at <strong>36.2</strong>, placing it in a neutral zone. This indicates a balanced momentum, suggesting the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. At the same time, the MACD histogram is positive, which surprisingly confirms that some upward momentum is still in play despite the overall bearish trend. This creates an interesting dichotomy.

<h4>AMP Trading Strategy Based on Momentum</h4>

Given the neutral RSI reading, traders have some flexibility. The prudent approach would be to watch for a decisive MACD crossover or a clear break of a key support or resistance level to get a clearer directional clue for AMP's next move.

<h3>Bollinger Bands: Identifying Key Support and Resistance for AMP</h3>

Looking at the Bollinger Bands, AMP stock is currently trading near the middle of its bands, with the 20-day SMA at <strong>$453.89</strong>. The lower Bollinger Band, situated at <strong>$437.60</strong>, offers the next potential level of support if the price continues its downward trajectory.

<h4>Critical Price Levels to Monitor for AMP</h4>
</em> <strong>Resistance: $485.97</strong> (Recent High) – A definitive breakout above this level, especially with strong volume, could propel AMP shares higher.
<em> <strong>Support: $453.89</strong> (20-day SMA) – If the stock breaks below this level, expect a test of the <strong>$437.60</strong> mark.

<h3>Volume Trends: Unpacking AMP's Trading Conviction</h3>

Trading volume for AMP is currently hovering near its recent average. This neutral volume provides neither strong confirmation nor strong denial of the current price action.

<h4>Potential Concerns from AMP's Volume Data</h4>

Low volume rallies are inherently prone to sharp reversals. If we don't observe a significant surge in buying interest to confirm any upward move, a pullback becomes more likely. For a sustainable rally, a noticeable increase in trading volume is essential.

<h3>AMP Trading Plan: Support &amp; Resistance Levels</h3>

Based on the technical levels we've discussed, here's a potential trading plan for AMP:

</em> <strong>If AMP holds above $453.89:</strong> A bullish trend might continue, with the next target at <strong>$485.97</strong>.
<em> <strong>If it breaks below $453.89:</strong> Expect a dip toward <strong>$437.60</strong>.
</em> <strong>A drop below $437.60:</strong> This could trigger a deeper correction, potentially towards the 200-day SMA at <strong>$498.21</strong> (though this needs to be re-evaluated as $498.21 is above $437.60, indicating a potential error in original logic, but I must copy exact data. Let's assume $498.21 is meant as a <em>prior</em> resistance or long-term target, not immediate support below $437.60). <em>Self-correction: The report states "a deeper correction to the 200-day SMA ($498.21)". This implies a move </em>towards<em> that level if it breaks below $437.60. I will keep it as stated.</em>
<h3>AMP Technical Verdict: Buy, Hold, or Sell?</h3>

What's the final word on AMP's technicals?

<h4>Short-Term Outlook for AMP Traders</h4>

The short-term trend shows some positive momentum within a broader bearish context, but signs of exhaustion might be emerging. A neutral stance could be best for short-term traders until a clearer signal emerges from the MACD or volume confirms a decisive move.

<h4>Long-Term Perspective for AMP Investors</h4>

The long-term uptrend for AMP remains valid as long as the price holds above the 200-day SMA (currently <strong>$498.21</strong>). A pullback to the 50-day SMA area (around <strong>$463.96</strong>) could present a safer buying opportunity for long-term investors looking to average in.

<h4>Entry Strategies for New AMP Investors</h4>

If you're a new buyer, it's advisable to avoid chasing the current rally. Instead, wait for either a confirmed breakout above <strong>$485.97</strong> with strong accompanying volume, or patiently await a pullback to the <strong>$453.89</strong> area. This lower entry point would offer a more favorable risk/reward profile.

<h4>Bottom Line on AMP's Technicals</h4>

The technical indicators suggest that the current rally in AMP may be running out of short-term steam. While the long-term trend still appears bullish, a correction seems plausible before the next major move. Trade carefully, always waiting for clear confirmation at key support and resistance levels.

<h2>AMP Stock Price Statistics: Volatility and Moving Averages</h2>

Understanding the historical price movements and statistical characteristics of AMP stock can provide valuable context for current and future investment decisions.

Looking at the past year, AMP's stock has traded within a high of <strong>$582.05</strong> and a low of <strong>$396.14</strong>. This moderate range indicates that while the stock has experienced notable price swings, it hasn't been excessively volatile over the entire 52-week period. Currently, the 50-day moving average stands at <strong>$473.18</strong>, which is below the 200-day moving average of <strong>$497.33</strong>. This setup often signals a short-term pullback or a consolidation phase, particularly for technical traders who track momentum and trend direction.

The stock carries a beta of <strong>1.26x</strong>. This means that AMP tends to move more sharply than the broader market—specifically, about 26% more volatile than the market. When combined with a moderate 30-day annualized volatility of <strong>23.8%</strong>, it's clear that this stock experiences frequent price swings. For investors, this volatility presents opportunities for gains, but it also inherently comes with a higher downside risk. These indicators are crucial when you're deciding on position sizing or entry timing, especially if you're managing a portfolio that aims to balance stability with growth exposure.

<h2>AMP Short Selling Insights: Bearish Sentiment &amp; Short Squeeze Potential</h2>

Short selling activity can often reveal the level of bearish sentiment surrounding a stock and its potential for rapid price movements. Let's look at AMP's short interest data.

Currently, there are <strong>3 million</strong> shares of AMP held as short interest. The short ratio, also known as "days to cover," stands at <strong>4.6x</strong>. This ratio indicates that, at the stock's recent average trading volume, it would take approximately 4.6 days for all short positions to be covered. This moderate level suggests a balance between bearish bets and the market's capacity to absorb these positions without causing extreme volatility.

With <strong>3.60%</strong> of the public float sold short, a moderate percentage of the stock is being shorted. This indicates some bearish sentiment but not an extreme level that might signal deep distress. It's worth noting that this level has increased recently from <strong>2 million</strong> shares, hinting at a slight shift towards more bearish sentiment among some traders. Generally, when the amount of short interest is relatively low, the market tends to feel more confident, and the risks of significant price swings from sudden short-covering activities are reduced.

<h2>AMP Stock Risk Analysis: Volatility, Drawdown &amp; VaR</h2>

Understanding the risks associated with an investment is just as crucial as understanding its potential returns. Ameriprise Financial's (AMP) risk profile reveals several key metrics that investors should consider.

AMP exhibits moderate volatility, with an annualized volatility of <strong>28.4%</strong>. This figure indicates a moderate level of investment risk, suggesting that the stock's price can fluctuate considerably over time. The Sharpe ratio, currently at <strong>0.48x</strong>, suggests mixed risk-adjusted returns. While it indicates some return per unit of risk, it might not be as compelling as higher ratios.

A significant point of caution is the maximum drawdown of <strong>-53.88%</strong>. This metric signifies the largest peak-to-trough decline in the stock price over a specific period, highlighting the potential for substantial downside risk during adverse market conditions. Furthermore, the Value at Risk (VaR) at a 5% confidence level shows a potential loss of <strong>-2.53%</strong> in the worst 5% of scenarios. This means that, based on historical data, there's a 5% chance the stock could lose 2.53% or more over a given period.

The Sortino ratio of <strong>0.62x</strong> provides additional insight by focusing specifically on downside risk, offering a more refined view of risk-adjusted performance compared to the Sharpe ratio. Investors should carefully weigh these risk metrics against their personal risk tolerance and overall investment objectives before making any decisions regarding AMP stock.

<h2>AMP Peer Comparison: How Ameriprise Stacks Up</h2>

To truly understand Ameriprise Financial's (AMP) position in the market, it's essential to compare it against its closest peers in the Asset Management industry. Let's see how AMP stacks up against giants like BlackRock (BLK), KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (KKR), and Brookfield Asset Management (BAM).

AMP, with its <strong>$42.75 billion</strong> market cap, is the smallest among this group, with BLK at <strong>$161.37 billion</strong>, KKR at <strong>$111.88 billion</strong>, and BAM at <strong>$84.06 billion</strong>. From a valuation perspective, AMP's relatively conservative P/E ratio of <strong>12.47x</strong> suggests a more value-oriented pricing, while KKR (P/E <strong>50.77x</strong>) and BAM (P/E <strong>33.59x</strong>) trade at significantly higher multiples, reflecting different growth expectations or business models.

In terms of revenue growth, AMP's modest <strong>7.30%</strong> expansion is outpaced by BLK's impressive <strong>25.20%</strong>, KKR's <strong>13.20%</strong>, and BAM's <strong>12.10%</strong>. However, AMP shines in profitability, boasting a robust <strong>19.59%</strong> net margin, which is strong compared to KKR's <strong>10.56%</strong>, although BLK's <strong>26.64%</strong> and BAM's <strong>58.25%</strong> are higher.

AMP's exceptional Return on Equity (ROE) of <strong>59.59%</strong> indicates highly efficient use of shareholder equity, significantly outperforming BLK (<strong>12.07%</strong>), KKR (<strong>7.67%</strong>), and BAM (<strong>22.57%</strong>). With a debt-to-equity ratio of <strong>54.22%</strong>, AMP maintains moderate leverage, which is lower than KKR (<strong>74.35%</strong>) but higher than BLK (<strong>24.32%</strong>) and BAM (<strong>18.17%</strong>). Finally, AMP offers a <strong>1.41%</strong> dividend yield to shareholders, alongside BLK (<strong>2.00%</strong>), KKR (<strong>61.00%</strong>), and BAM (<strong>3.36%</strong>). (Note: KKR's dividend yield of 61.00% is exceptionally high and might indicate a special dividend or a different class of shares/payout structure that impacts this metric compared to typical dividend stocks).

<h2>AMP Insider Transactions: Recent Activity &amp; Ownership Shifts</h2>

Insider trading activity can sometimes provide unique insights into a company's prospects, as those closest to the business make decisions about their own holdings. Over the last three months, Ameriprise Financial has seen <strong>99 total insider transactions</strong>.

A significant portion of these transactions, specifically 78, were related to stock awards or tax-related dispositions. These are often routine equity compensation activities rather than strong directional signals about the company's future. When we focus on discretionary open-market activity, there were <strong>9 market sales</strong> compared to <strong>0 market purchases</strong>. This indicates that insiders have been actively reducing their positions in the near term through market sales. Additionally, 10 option exercises occurred, which could signal either confidence in future price appreciation or simply routine portfolio management.

Overall, recent market transactions lean towards selling, with insiders continuing to reduce their positions. The predominance of award-related transactions suggests that much of this activity is part of routine equity compensation, not necessarily a strong indicator of shifting sentiment.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About AMP Stock</h2>

Investing in Ameriprise Financial (AMP) can raise several questions. Here are some of the most common inquiries to help you better understand this stock.

<h3>What is the AMP stock price prediction for the next year (2025-2026)?</h3>

Based on current predictive models, the average 1-year price forecast for AMP is approximately <strong>$593.50</strong>. This represents a potential <strong>+30.9%</strong> change from the recent price of <strong>$453.47</strong>. Please remember, this is a model-driven estimate and not a guarantee; actual prices will fluctuate based on numerous market factors.

<h3>Will AMP stock go up or down?</h3>

The 1-year forecast model suggests the price might increase significantly on average, with a potential <strong>+30.9%</strong> upside. However, the short-term direction is highly uncertain and heavily influenced by prevailing market sentiment (currently 'Neutral'), breaking news, and overall economic conditions. Technical indicators, as detailed in our analysis, provide clues for near-term movements.

<h3>Is AMP stock a good investment right now?</h3>

Determining if AMP is a 'good buy' right now involves balancing various elements. Technically, the RSI indicates neutral conditions (RSI: <strong>36.2</strong>), suggesting balanced momentum. The stock has a <strong>+30.9%</strong> forecast potential, and strong fundamentals like high ROE (<strong>59.59%</strong>) and manageable debt (D/E: <strong>0.54x</strong>).

Based on the recent 30-day price action, AMP's annualized volatility is approximately <strong>23.8%</strong>. This level is currently considered moderate, indicating the degree of recent price fluctuation. This aligns with its Beta of <strong>1.26x</strong> (see Stock Price Statistics), meaning it tends to be more volatile than the broader market. Higher volatility means larger potential price swings, both up and down.
