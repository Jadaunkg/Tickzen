The big question on everyone's mind is whether WWW's current stock price truly reflects its value and if the company is geared up for future growth. Should you consider adding Wolverine World Wide to your portfolio right now? Let's break down its recent performance and future potential.</p>
<p>Currently trading at <strong>$16.28</strong> (as of late November 2025), WWW stock finds itself in a bearish trend, positioned below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

However, it's worth noting the stock's significant annualized volatility of <strong>84.4%</strong>, which means we can expect some wide price swings.</p>
<p>When we look at Wolverine World Wide's fundamentals, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On the positive side, the company boasts solid revenue growth, up <strong>6.80%</strong> year-over-year.

<h3>Wolverine World Wide's Core Business &amp; Brands</h3>
<p>To truly understand WWW's potential, we need to grasp its core business. Wolverine World Wide, Inc. is a global company involved in the design, manufacture, sourcing, marketing, licensing, and distribution of footwear, apparel, and accessories. Their reach extends across the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, Canada, and Latin America, operating primarily through its Active Group and Work Group segments.</p>
<p>The company offers a diverse range of products, including casual footwear and apparel, performance outdoor and athletic footwear and apparel, kids' footwear, industrial work boots and apparel, and uniform shoes and boots. They manage an impressive portfolio of well-known brands such as Bates, Cat, Chaco, Harley-Davidson, Hush Puppies, Hytest, Merrell, Saucony, Sperry, Keds, Sweaty Betty, and Wolverine. Additionally, they license the Stride Rite brand.</p>
<p>Wolverine World Wide also markets Merrell and Wolverine branded apparel and accessories, and licenses its brands for non-footwear products, including Hush Puppies apparel, eyewear, watches, socks, handbags, and plush toys, as well as Wolverine branded eyewear and gloves. Their Wolverine Leather division markets pigskin leather, and a dedicated sourcing division provides crucial consulting services for product development, production control, quality assurance, and materials procurement.</p>

<h2>Wolverine World Wide (WWW) Valuation Analysis</h2>
<p>While the market recognizes Wolverine World Wide, Inc. as a key player in the Footwear &amp; Accessories industry with its <strong>$1.33 billion</strong> market cap, its enterprise value (EV) tells a slightly different story. The EV stands at a higher <strong>$2.02 billion</strong>, with <strong>$690.00 million</strong> of that value attributed to debt. This suggests that while investors are confident about future earnings, the significant debt load is a factor to consider.</p>
<p>Looking at the valuation ratios, WWW trades at <strong>1.10x</strong> revenue and <strong>11.86x</strong> EBITDA. These multiples reflect the company's established market position and strong brand assets, indicating that you're paying for quality. However, this also implies less room for error in performance. The upcoming <strong>2026-01-02</strong> ex-dividend date serves as a reminder that Wolverine World Wide continues to reward shareholders even as it focuses on growth initiatives.</p>

<h2>WWW Stock Share Statistics: Ownership &amp; Short Interest</h2>
<p>When you look at WWW's share structure, about <strong>7.3%</strong> of the company's shares are closely held by insiders or strategic investors, leaving approximately <strong>76 million</strong> shares available for public trading. This high float generally allows investors to trade the stock without causing significant price shifts. However, it's always a possibility that the company could issue more shares, which might dilute the value of existing stock.</p>
<p>Executives and major shareholders collectively own a relatively small portion, about <strong>1.91%</strong>, of the company. This level of ownership typically helps align their interests with those of general shareholders. On the flip side, institutional ownership is quite significant, coming in at <strong>112.03%</strong>. This high level of institutional backing often provides a degree of stability and confidence in the stock.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about short interest. There are currently 7 million shares shorted, representing 14.75% of the float. This indicates that a substantial part of the market is betting against the stock, signaling a perception of high risk. It's crucial to watch for changes in short interest; a sharp increase could mean more investors are growing doubtful.</p><p>Conversely, very low short interest during positive news can sometimes prevent a 'short squeeze' from happening. For more detailed ownership information, checking the company's latest SEC filings can be very insightful.</p>

<h2>WWW Stock Valuation Metrics: P/E, Price/Sales, EV/EBITDA</h2>
<p>When we look at Wolverine World Wide's valuation, the numbers tell an interesting story. With a Trailing P/E ratio of <strong>15.21x</strong> and a Forward P/E of <strong>12.43x</strong>, WWW might be presenting an attractive valuation opportunity. These figures often suggest that the market expects positive earnings growth ahead.</p>
<p>Beyond earnings, the Price/Sales ratio of <strong>$0.72</strong> and Price/Book ratio of <strong>$3.54</strong> indicate how the company is valued relative to its revenue and book value. These metrics are crucial for understanding WWW's market positioning and whether it's trading at reasonable multiples within its industry.</p>
<p>From an enterprise value perspective, the EV/Revenue ratio of <strong>1.10x</strong> points to a sensible valuation based on sales, while the EV/EBITDA multiple of <strong>11.86x</strong> suggests its earnings-based valuation is also quite rational. Together, these valuation metrics offer a comprehensive view of Wolverine World Wide's current standing in the market.</p>

<h2>Wolverine World Wide's Financial Health &amp; Liquidity</h2>
<p>Wolverine World Wide's financial data reveals both notable strengths and areas to watch. The company demonstrates highly efficient use of capital, with Return on Equity (ROE) at <strong>27.63%</strong> and Return on Assets (ROA) at <strong>5.22%</strong>. These figures are often characteristic of fast-growing firms that are adept at generating profits from their assets and shareholder equity.</p>
<p>However, the Debt/Equity ratio of <strong>2.10x</strong>, coupled with <strong>$822.10 million</strong> in total debt against <strong>$133.90 million</strong> in cash, signals that WWW has taken on a considerable amount of debt to fuel its operations and growth initiatives. Despite this leverage, the company's ability to generate <strong>$76.20 million</strong> in operating cash flow (TTM) is a significant strength, proving that its core business can consistently produce cash.</p>
<p>In terms of liquidity, the Current Ratio of <strong>1.34x</strong> and Quick Ratio of <strong>0.65x</strong> suggest a solid position to cover its short-term liabilities. Furthermore, WWW's <strong>$54.75 million</strong> in levered free cash flow indicates that it can still generate substantial cash for shareholders even after meeting all its financial obligations. This balance of debt and strong cash generation is crucial for its ongoing financial health.</p>

<h2>WWW Stock Financial Efficiency: Asset, Inventory, &amp; Cash Conversion</h2>
<p>Wolverine World Wide's operational efficiency is an important aspect for investors to consider. Its Asset Turnover of <strong>1.11x</strong> suggests that the company generates <strong>$1.11</strong> in revenue for every dollar of assets, indicating a solid ability to utilize its asset base effectively.</p>
<p>Looking at inventory, an Inventory Turnover of <strong>4.05x</strong> means Wolverine World Wide sells and replaces its inventory roughly four times a year, which translates to about <strong>90.1 Days Inventory Outstanding</strong>. On the receivables front, a healthy Receivables Turnover of <strong>8.84x</strong> and <strong>41.3 Days Sales Outstanding</strong> indicate strong collection practices, meaning customers are paying their bills quickly.</p>
<p>The Working Capital Turnover of <strong>11.91x</strong> highlights a highly efficient use of short-term assets to support sales, further supported by a Current Ratio of <strong>1.34x</strong>, signaling adequate liquidity. However, the Cash Conversion Cycle of approximately <strong>131.4 days (partial)</strong> suggests it takes about 4.4 months to convert inventory and receivables into cash. This extended cycle could potentially strain working capital.</p>
<p>Finally, Wolverine World Wide's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) stands at <strong>9.13%</strong>, indicating a moderate level of capital efficiency. This shows how effectively the company generates returns from the capital it has invested. Overall, while WWW shows areas of strength in asset utilization, there's room for improvement in optimizing its cash conversion process. It's always wise to compare these figures with industry peers to gain a competitive perspective.</p>

<h2>Wolverine World Wide (WWW) Profitability &amp; Growth Metrics</h2>
<p>A closer look at Wolverine World Wide's margin performance reveals that the company generally maintains solid control over its costs and pricing strategies. The gross margin of <strong>46.58%</strong> demonstrates success in managing production costs, while an operating margin of <strong>8.57%</strong> indicates healthy profitability from its core operations.</p>
<p>The EBITDA margin of <strong>9.27%</strong> suggests WWW is capable of generating strong cash flow from its operations before accounting for financing and tax strategies. All things considered, Wolverine World Wide manages to retain about <strong>$4.850</strong> in net profit for every dollar of revenue over the last twelve months. While the business is growing aggressively with a <strong>6.80%</strong> quarterly revenue growth year-over-year, investors should monitor if this pace can be sustained without eroding those crucial profit margins.</p>
<p>WWW's <strong>$171.70 million</strong> in EBITDA and <strong>$862.50 million</strong> in gross profit highlight its raw earning power. The <strong>$87.20 million</strong> in net income then shows how effectively this power translates into bottom-line results. It appears the company is balancing its pursuit of growth with the need to maintain profitability. However, there's a significant difference between the gross and net margins (<strong>46.58%</strong> vs. <strong>4.85%</strong>), likely due to operating expenses, interest costs, or taxes, which are key areas for investors to scrutinize.</p>
<p>Moving forward, maintaining or improving these margins will be critical. WWW needs to defend its pricing power and control operating costs effectively, especially if revenue growth were to moderate. This strategic focus will be essential for sustaining long-term profitability.</p>

<h2>WWW Stock Dividends &amp; Shareholder Returns Analysis</h2>
<h3>Wolverine World Wide Dividend Overview</h3>
<p>For income-focused investors, Wolverine World Wide currently offers an annual dividend of <strong>$0.40 per share</strong>. This translates to a dividend yield of <strong>2.46%</strong>, meaning for every $100 invested, shareholders would receive $0.40 annually in dividends. What's interesting is that this current yield is slightly above its 5-year average of <strong>2.39%</strong>, potentially making it more attractive to income investors today compared to its recent historical performance.</p>
<h4>Key Dividend Insights &amp; Payout Ratio</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>payout ratio of 37.38%</strong> is quite healthy. This indicates that the company uses only about 37% of its earnings to fund its dividends, leaving plenty of room for future increases or reinvestment back into the business for growth initiatives.</li>
<li>While the trailing yield is listed as <strong>0.02%</strong>, this figure often suggests a recent dividend initiation or a special, non-recurring payout. It’s always wise to verify the consistency of regular dividend payments.</li>
<li>To receive the next dividend, investors must own the stock before the upcoming <strong>ex-dividend date of 2026-01-02</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Investor Takeaways: Income vs. Growth Perspective</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>For Income Investors:</strong> The modest yield and low payout ratio suggest that the dividends are safe, but they might not be the primary driver for investing in WWW. The focus here could be more on potential future dividend growth rather than a high immediate yield.</li>
<li><strong>For Growth Investors:</strong> The low payout ratio is a strong signal that a significant portion of earnings is being reinvested into the company. This strategic reinvestment could fuel future price appreciation, making it appealing for those focused on capital gains.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What to Watch for in WWW Dividends</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep an eye out for announcements of dividend hikes, which could bring the yield closer to or above its historical average.</li>
<li>Also, monitor any significant stock price changes, as these would naturally alter the effective dividend yield for new investors.</li>

<h2>Wolverine World Wide (WWW) Technical Analysis: Trends &amp; Indicators</h2>
<p><strong>CURRENT PRICE: $16.28 | TREND: BEARISH AND CONTINUES TO WEAKEN</strong></p>
<p>Wolverine World Wide (WWW) has seen a notable run recently, gaining <strong>+3.37% in just 15 days</strong>. However, several technical signals suggest we should approach this momentum with caution. Let's break down what the charts are telling us and how investors might position themselves.</p>
<h3>WWW Stock Trend Strength: Navigating Bearish Signals</h3>
<p>WWW is currently in a bearish trend, trading below its key moving averages. This setup generally signals caution for traders and investors.</p>
<h4>Trading Implications of WWW's Bearish Trend</h4>
<p>The <strong>20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $15.62</strong> is now acting as overhead resistance. As long as the price remains below this level, the bearish trend is likely to persist. A rejection from this moving average could potentially lead to a test of recent lows, so keep a close eye on this level.</p>
<h3>Momentum Analysis: RSI &amp; MACD for WWW Stock</h3>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for WWW sits at <strong>53.2</strong>, which is right in the neutral zone. This reading suggests a balanced momentum, meaning the stock is neither overbought nor oversold at this precise moment. Simultaneously, the MACD histogram is positive, indicating that some upward momentum is still in play, especially in the short term.</p>
<h4>Strategic Trading with WWW Momentum Indicators</h4>
<p>This neutral RSI reading offers flexibility for traders. It's often a good idea to watch for a decisive MACD crossover or a clear break of a key support or resistance level to get a stronger clue about the stock's next directional move. These indicators, when combined, can help confirm or contradict each other, providing a more robust trading signal.</p>
<h3>WWW Bollinger Bands: Identifying Key Price Levels</h3>
<p>Looking at the Bollinger Bands, WWW stock is currently trading comfortably in the upper half, positioned between the 20-day SMA and the upper band. This can be interpreted as a sign of underlying strength, indicating that buyers are showing some conviction.</p>
<h4>Critical Support &amp; Resistance from Bollinger Bands</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resistance:</strong> Keep an eye on <strong>$25.26</strong>, which represents a recent high. A decisive breakout above this level could propel WWW shares higher.</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> The <strong>20-day SMA at $15.62</strong> acts as immediate support. If this level breaks, we might see a test of <strong>$14.64</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Volume Trends: Conviction Behind WWW's Price Moves</h3>
<p>While the stock has been rising, it's crucial to note that trading volume has been declining, falling below its 20-day average. This is often considered a red flag for the sustainability of a trend.</p>
<h4>Understanding Low Volume Rallies in WWW</h4>
<p>Low volume rallies are typically prone to sharp reversals. If we don't see a significant surge in buying interest to confirm this recent upward movement, a pullback becomes more likely. Volume provides conviction, and without it, rallies can often be short-lived.</p>
<h3>WWW Stock Support &amp; Resistance: Your Trading Plan</h3>
<h4>Executing Your WWW Trading Strategy</h4>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>If WWW holds above $15.62:</strong> The bullish trend could continue, with the next target at <strong>$25.26</strong>.</li>
<li>⚠️ <strong>If it breaks below $15.62:</strong> Expect a dip toward <strong>$14.64</strong>.</li>
<li>🛑 <strong>A drop below $14.64:</strong> This could trigger a deeper correction, potentially heading towards the 200-day SMA at <strong>$22.58</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>WWW Stock: Buy, Hold, or Sell? A Technical Verdict</h3>
<h4>Technical Outlook for Short-Term WWW Traders</h4>
<p>For short-term traders, the current trend appears positive, but it's important to monitor for signs of exhaustion. A neutral stance might be the most prudent until a clearer signal emerges from the MACD or trading volume. Patience is key here.</p>
<h4>Long-Term Technical View for WWW Investors</h4>
<p>Long-term investors can consider the uptrend valid as long as the price holds above the 200-day SMA (<strong>$22.58</strong>). A pullback to the 50-day SMA area (<strong>$20.94</strong>) could present a safer buying opportunity, offering a better risk-reward profile.</p>
<h4>Entry Points for New WWW Stock Buyers</h4>
<p>New buyers might want to avoid chasing the current rally. Instead, wait for either a confirmed breakout above <strong>$25.26</strong> accompanied by strong volume, or a pullback to the <strong>$15.62</strong> area, which would offer a more attractive entry point with a better risk-reward balance.</p>
<h4>Bottom Line: WWW Technical Analysis Summary</h4>
<p>The technical indicators suggest that the recent rally in WWW may be losing steam in the short term. While the long-term trend still holds some bullish undertones, a correction seems plausible before the next significant move. Trade carefully and always wait for clear confirmation at these key technical levels.</p>

<h2>WWW Stock Peer Comparison: Wolverine World Wide vs. Industry Leaders</h2>
<p>To put Wolverine World Wide (WWW) into perspective, let's compare it against some of its key competitors in the Footwear &amp; Accessories industry, such as Nike (NKE), Deckers Outdoor (DECK), and Crocs (CROX). WWW's <strong>$1.33 billion</strong> market cap positions it as the smallest player among these giants, with NKE at <strong>$95.09 billion</strong>, DECK at <strong>$12.93 billion</strong>, and CROX at <strong>$4.67 billion</strong>.</p>
<p>WWW's conservative P/E ratio of <strong>15.21x</strong> suggests a value-oriented pricing approach, especially when compared to NKE's <strong>32.99x</strong> and CROX's <strong>29.67x</strong>. Interestingly, DECK trades at a much lower multiple of <strong>12.96x</strong>, which might reflect a more mature or slower-growth business profile. In terms of revenue growth, WWW's modest <strong>6.80%</strong> expansion is lower than DECK's <strong>9.10%</strong> but outperforms NKE's <strong>1.10%</strong> and CROX's decline of <strong>-6.20%</strong>.</p>
<p>Profitability is another key differentiator. WWW's <strong>4.85%</strong> net margin shows positive but modest profitability. This is lower than NKE's <strong>6.23%</strong> and significantly trails DECK's impressive <strong>19.36%</strong>. However, it's slightly better than CROX's <strong>4.48%</strong>. When it comes to efficiency, WWW's exceptional <strong>27.63%</strong> Return on Equity (ROE) indicates highly efficient use of shareholder equity, outperforming NKE's <strong>21.12%</strong> and CROX's <strong>11.82%</strong>, though behind DECK's <strong>43.31%</strong>.</p>
<p>The company's financial leverage is evident in its high <strong>210</strong> Debt-to-Equity ratio. This is a higher leverage level than NKE (<strong>82.13</strong>) and DECK (<strong>14.22</strong>), but CROX (<strong>125</strong>) also shows significant leverage. Finally, WWW offers a <strong>2.46%</strong> dividend yield to shareholders, comparable to NKE's <strong>2.55%</strong>, while DECK and CROX currently do not pay dividends.</p>

<h2>WWW Stock Insider Transactions: Recent Buys &amp; Sells</h2>
<p>Looking at insider activity over the last three months, we've seen 15 transactions involving WWW stock. It's important to distinguish between discretionary market transactions and non-discretionary ones. A significant portion (7) were stock awards or tax-related dispositions, which aren't direct market bets. There were also 4 option exercises, which could signal confidence or simply routine portfolio management.</p>
<p>However, focusing on the discretionary market activity, we observed 3 open-market purchases compared to just 1 sale. This suggests that insiders, those with the deepest knowledge of the company, are seeing value at current prices and are increasing their financial commitment. The predominance of insider buying, especially in open-market transactions, generally sends a positive signal to the market.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About WWW Stock</h2>
<h3>What is the WWW stock price prediction for the next year (2025-2026)?</h3>
<p>Based on current models, the average 1-year price forecast for WWW is approximately <strong>$29.69</strong>. This represents a potential <strong>+82.4%</strong> change from the recent price of <strong>$16.28</strong>. Keep in mind that this is a model-driven estimate and actual prices can fluctuate significantly due to numerous market factors.</p>
<h3>Will WWW stock go up or down?</h3>
<p>The 1-year forecast model suggests that the price might show strong gains on average (<strong>+82.4%</strong> potential). However, the short-term direction is highly uncertain and can be heavily influenced by prevailing market sentiment (currently 'Neutral'), breaking news, and overall economic conditions. Technical indicators, as discussed in the Technical Analysis section, can provide clues for near-term direction.</p>
<h3>Is WWW stock a good investment right now?</h3>
<p>Deciding if WWW is a 'good buy' right now involves balancing various elements: the 'Neutral' technicals, a substantial <strong>+82.4%</strong> forecast potential, and its valuation. Technically, the RSI indicates neutral conditions (RSI: <strong>53.2</strong>), suggesting balanced momentum. Investors should weigh the company's valuation, stability, and growth against identified risk factors, such as the high Debt-to-Equity ratio. It's essential to align this with your own investment goals and risk profile.</p>
<h3>How volatile is WWW stock?</h3>
<p>Based on the recent 30-day price action, WWW's annualized volatility is approximately <strong>84.4%</strong>. This level is considered elevated, indicating a significant degree of recent price fluctuation. This aligns with its Beta of <strong>1.93x</strong>, meaning it tends to move more sharply than the broader market. Higher volatility means larger potential price swings, both up and down.</p>
<h3>What is WWW's P/E ratio and what does it mean?</h3>
<p>WWW's Trailing P/E ratio (based on past earnings) is <strong>15.21x</strong>, which is considered moderate. The Forward P/E (based on expected earnings) is <strong>12.43x</strong>. A P/E ratio indicates how much investors are paying per dollar of earnings. It's best to compare this ratio to industry peers and the company's historical levels. A high P/E isn't necessarily negative if strong growth prospects justify it.</p>
<h3>What are the key upcoming events for WWW?</h3>
<p>A key upcoming event for income investors is the ex-dividend date on <strong>2026-01-02</strong>. Beyond this, analysts and investors should closely monitor macroeconomic shifts, competitive actions within the Footwear &amp; Accessories industry, and any major corporate announcements or earnings reports from Wolverine World Wide.</p>
<h3>What does WWW's liquidity position reveal about its financial health?</h3>
<p>WWW's financial health includes an adequate Current Ratio of <strong>1.34x</strong>, which suggests it can cover its short-term liabilities. However, its robust operating cash flow (<strong>$76.20 million</strong>) and levered free cash flow (<strong>$54.75 million</strong>) provide a significant buffer. These cash flow figures are critical factors in the company's ability to fund its operations and manage its debt obligations effectively.</p>
