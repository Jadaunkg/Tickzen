<p>Currently, DJT’s stock is trading at <strong>$11.54</strong>. The technical picture is clearly bearish, as the price remains below both its 50-day moving average (at <strong>$13.79</strong>) and 200-day moving average (at <strong>$17.61</strong>). This indicates a lack of sustained upward momentum over the medium to long term.</p>
<p>However, it's not all doom and gloom on the technical front. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a neutral <strong>61.4</strong>, suggesting the stock isn't currently overbought or oversold. Interestingly, the MACD indicator shows a bullish short-term trend with a value of <strong>0.23</strong>, which could hint at minor pullbacks before any potential upward movement. You can track DJT's live data and charts on <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DJT" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a> for real-time updates.</p>
<p>Looking at the past year, DJT has seen a wide trading range, from a low of <strong>$10.18</strong> to a high of <strong>$43.46</strong>. This volatility indicates that the stock has experienced significant pullbacks from its peak. With the current price near the lower end of this range, major sudden swings might be less likely unless there's significant news.</p>
<p>Analysts are projecting a cautious outlook, with a 1-year target of <strong>$4.62</strong>, representing a potential <strong>-60.0%</strong> decline. Additionally, institutional ownership stands at <strong>23.79%</strong>, and while not extremely high, the short interest at <strong>8.42%</strong> of the float suggests a notable portion of investors are betting against the stock. This combination indicates that while some big players are invested, there's also a significant bearish sentiment to consider.</p>

<h2>Company Profile: Understanding Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp. (DJT)</h2>
<p>To truly understand DJT's stock, we need to grasp what the company actually does. Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp. operates within the Communication Services sector, specifically in the Internet Content &amp; Information industry. With a current market capitalization of <strong>$3.23 billion</strong> and a team of <strong>29 employees</strong>, it’s a relatively lean operation for its valuation.</p>
<p>The company's official website, <a href="https://tmtgcorp.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://tmtgcorp.com</a>, provides more details on their offerings. At its core, DJT is involved in social media and streaming services, primarily targeting the United States market. Their flagship product is <strong>Truth Social</strong>, a social media platform that emphasizes free expression. Beyond that, they operate <strong>Truth+</strong>, a streaming platform focused on news, Christian content, and family-friendly programming.</p>
<p>Interestingly, DJT has also ventured into the financial sector with <strong>Truth.Fi</strong>, a FinTech brand aiming to incorporate "America First" investment vehicles. Founded in 2021 and headquartered in Sarasota, Florida, the company continues to develop its ecosystem of services.</p>
<h2>Total Valuation: Diving into DJT's Financial Standing</h2>
<p>Let's talk about valuation. While Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp. carries a market cap of <strong>$3.23 billion</strong>, its enterprise value (EV) comes in lower at <strong>$2.88 billion</strong>. This difference is significant, reflecting a robust net cash position of approximately <strong>$350 million</strong>. Such financial strength can offer a substantial cushion and provides flexibility for future strategic investments or navigating market headwinds.</p>
<p>When we look at the valuation ratios, they paint an intriguing picture. DJT trades at <strong>783.31x</strong> EV/Revenue (TTM) and <strong>-16.39x</strong> EV/EBITDA (TTM). These multiples suggest that the market is assigning a premium to the company, likely recognizing its strong brand assets and unique market position. However, paying a premium also means there's less room for operational missteps. In essence, investors are paying for perceived quality and potential, which often comes at a higher price.</p>

<h2>Share Statistics: Understanding DJT's Ownership Structure and Short Interest</h2>
<p>Understanding who owns a company's shares and how many are available for public trading can provide valuable insights. For DJT, approximately <strong>44.6%</strong> of its shares are held closely by insiders or strategic investors, aligning their interests with the company's long-term success. The remaining <strong>155 million</strong> shares constitute the public float.</p>
<p>With a relatively high float, DJT's stock is generally liquid, meaning investors can typically trade it without causing significant price dislocations. However, it's always a consideration that the company could issue more shares, potentially diluting the value of existing stock in the future. Executives and major shareholders hold a substantial <strong>42.18%</strong> stake, which is often seen as a positive, indicating strong alignment with shareholder interests.</p>
<p>Institutional ownership, however, is comparatively small at <strong>23.79%</strong>, which is lower than what you’d typically find in widely held stocks. This could suggest that larger institutional investors are either cautious about DJT's performance or simply haven't made it a significant focus in their portfolios.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at short interest, which is a key indicator of bearish sentiment. With <strong>14 million</strong> shares currently shorted, representing <strong>8.42%</strong> of the float, there's a notable level of investors betting against DJT. Monitoring changes in this figure is crucial; a sharp increase could signal growing skepticism, while a decline might reduce the potential for a "short squeeze" scenario.</p>
<p>Considering all these factors, while DJT is liquid and accessible for trading, sustained price growth may require stronger backing from both institutional investors and company insiders to truly take off.</p>

<h2>Valuation Metrics: A Deeper Dive into DJT's Market Positioning</h2>
<p>Beyond the simple share price, a company's valuation metrics offer a comprehensive view of how the market perceives its intrinsic worth and future potential. For Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, these ratios provide critical insights into its current market positioning.</p>
<p>DJT's Price/Sales (TTM) ratio stands at a substantial <strong>$878.54</strong>, while its Price/Book (MRQ) is <strong>$1.42x</strong>. These multiples are quite high and warrant careful attention from investors. A high Price/Sales ratio, in particular, suggests that the market is valuing each dollar of the company's revenue very highly, often indicative of strong growth expectations or a unique market position.</p>
<p>From an enterprise value perspective, the EV/Revenue (TTM) ratio of <strong>783.31x</strong> indicates a significant revenue-based valuation. The EV/EBITDA (TTM) multiple of <strong>-16.39x</strong>, while negative due to current profitability challenges, still offers an earnings-based valuation perspective. Collectively, these metrics help paint a picture of how the market is currently pricing DJT, highlighting its premium valuation and the high expectations that come with it.</p>

<h2>Financial Health: Assessing DJT's Balance Sheet and Cash Flow</h2>
<p>When evaluating any investment, understanding a company’s financial health is paramount. For DJT, the financial data reveals both areas of strength and areas that warrant investor scrutiny. The Return on Equity (ROE) of <strong>-9.32%</strong> and Return on Assets (ROA) of <strong>-5.59%</strong> indicate that the company is currently not generating positive returns from its capital and assets. These figures are typically found in companies that are either in a high-growth phase requiring significant investment or facing operational challenges.</p>
<p>On the debt front, DJT's Debt/Equity ratio of <strong>0.42x</strong> is manageable, especially when considering its cash position. With <strong>$953.56 million</strong> in total debt and a substantial <strong>$1.30 billion</strong> in total cash, the company appears to have a net cash position. This suggests that while it has taken on debt to fund operations and growth, it also possesses significant liquidity to offset it.</p>
<p>However, a major concern arises from the negative operating cash flow of <strong>-$5.70 million</strong> (TTM). This indicates that DJT’s core business operations are currently consuming more cash than they generate. Similarly, the levered free cash flow of <strong>-$353.59 million</strong> (TTM) further underscores the challenge of internal cash generation.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, DJT boasts a strong liquidity position, with a Current Ratio of <strong>42.78x</strong> and a Quick Ratio of <strong>33.81x</strong>. These high ratios suggest the company is exceptionally well-equipped to cover its short-term liabilities, providing a significant buffer against immediate financial pressures.</p>

<h2>Financial Efficiency: How Effectively DJT Manages Its Resources</h2>
<p>Beyond just looking at a company’s financial position, it's crucial to evaluate how efficiently it uses its assets and capital to generate revenue and profits. For Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, the efficiency metrics provide a nuanced perspective.</p>
<p>DJT's Receivables Turnover of <strong>211.37x</strong> and its impressively low <strong>1.7 Days Sales Outstanding</strong> indicate exceptional efficiency in collecting payments from customers. This means the company is getting paid very quickly, which is a strong positive for its cash flow management.</p>
<p>The Current Ratio of <strong>42.78x</strong>, as noted in the financial health section, further signals excellent liquidity. However, the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) at <strong>-15.62%</strong> suggests that the company's capital efficiency needs improvement. This metric shows how effectively DJT generates returns from all the capital invested in its operations, and a negative figure implies that it's currently destroying value from its investments.</p>
<p>Overall, while DJT excels in collecting receivables and maintains strong liquidity, it appears to face challenges in effectively utilizing its assets and invested capital to drive profitability. Investors should definitely compare these figures against industry peers to get a clearer picture of its competitive standing.

<h2>Profitability and Growth: Unpacking DJT's Earning Power</h2>
<p>Now, let's examine DJT's ability to generate profits and grow its business. The company's margin performance suggests it's under significant pressure. While the gross margin of <strong>59.42%</strong> indicates success in controlling production costs, the operating margin stands at an alarming <strong>-5926.45%</strong>. This vast difference points to extremely high operating expenses that are severely impacting profitability.</p>
<p>DJT's revenue for the trailing twelve months (TTM) is <strong>$3.68 million</strong>. However, its quarterly revenue growth year-over-year (YoY) shows a decline of <strong>-3.80%</strong>. This negative growth rate is a critical concern for investors looking for expanding businesses. While the company generated <strong>$2.19 million</strong> in gross profit, its EBITDA for the TTM was <strong>-$175.81 million</strong>, and net income was <strong>-$144.17 million</strong>. These negative figures clearly indicate that DJT is not currently profitable.</p>
<p>The significant gap between a healthy gross margin and deeply negative operating and net income margins highlights that high operational costs, and potentially interest expenses or taxes, are major drains on the company's financial performance. For DJT to achieve sustainable growth, it will be crucial to not only reverse its revenue decline but also gain much tighter control over its operating expenses. Maintaining or improving margins will be essential, especially if revenue growth remains challenging.</p>

<h2>Dividends and Shareholder Returns: DJT's Reinvestment Strategy</h2>
<p>For many investors, dividends are a key component of shareholder returns. However, it's important to note that <strong>DJT does not currently pay a regular dividend</strong>. This decision often signals that a company is prioritizing reinvesting its earnings back into the business. For a company like Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which is in a dynamic and competitive industry, this strategy likely aims to fuel growth, innovation, and market expansion rather than distributing cash to shareholders.</p>
<p>While the absence of a dividend might deter income-focused investors, it can be seen as a positive by growth-oriented investors who prefer to see capital allocated to initiatives that could drive future stock price appreciation. This approach is common among younger or high-growth technology companies that are still scaling their operations and market presence.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis: Decoding DJT's Price Action and Momentum</h2>
<p>As of <strong>November 29, 2025</strong>, DJT's current price stands at <strong>$11.54</strong>. The overall trend is clearly bearish and appears to be weakening. The stock has experienced downward pressure recently, losing <strong>-4.07%</strong> over the last 15 days. Let's break down the technical indicators to determine if this is a potential buying opportunity or a signal for further declines.</p>
<h3>Trend Strength – Still Bearish</h3>
<p>DJT is firmly entrenched in a bearish trend, trading below both its key moving averages. This situation typically signals caution for technical traders. The 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at <strong>$11.28</strong> is now acting as an overhead resistance level. As long as the price remains below this point, the bearish trend is likely to persist. A rejection from this average could lead to a re-test of recent lows.</p>
<h3>Momentum Check – Is Momentum Fading?</h3>
<p>The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at <strong>61.4</strong>, placing it in a neutral zone. This suggests that momentum is balanced, with the stock neither significantly overbought nor oversold. Simultaneously, the MACD histogram shows a positive reading, indicating that some upward momentum is still present in the short term. This creates a flexible trading strategy: watch for a decisive MACD crossover or a clear break of a key support or resistance level for the next directional cue.</p>
<h3>Bollinger Bands – Testing Key Levels</h3>
<p>The stock is currently trading comfortably in the upper half of its Bollinger Bands, specifically between the 20-day SMA and the upper band. This positioning can be interpreted as a sign of underlying strength, despite the broader bearish trend. It suggests buying interest might be present at current levels.</p>
<h4>Key Levels to Watch:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resistance:</strong> The recent high of <strong>$15.83</strong> is a critical resistance level. A confirmed breakout above this point, especially on strong volume, could propel DJT higher.</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> The 20-day SMA at <strong>$11.28</strong> acts as immediate support. If this level breaks, we could see a test of <strong>$9.28</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Volume Trends – Checking for Conviction</h3>
<p>Trading volume is currently near its recent average, offering neutral confirmation of the prevailing price action. This is where caution comes in: rallies on low volume can often be prone to sharp reversals. For any sustained upward move, we'd ideally want to see a surge in buying interest to validate the price action. Without that conviction, a pullback becomes more probable.</p>
<h3>Support &amp; Resistance – The Trading Plan</h3>
<p>Here’s a practical trading plan based on these key technical levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ If DJT manages to hold above <strong>$11.28</strong>, the bullish momentum could continue, with the next target being <strong>$15.83</strong>.</li>
<li>⚠️ If the stock breaks below <strong>$11.28</strong>, expect a dip towards <strong>$9.28</strong>.</li>
<li>🛑 A drop below <strong>$9.28</strong> could potentially trigger a deeper correction, possibly even reaching the 200-day SMA at <strong>$17.61</strong> (though the current price is far below this, indicating a significant rally would be needed to reach it).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Verdict – Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell DJT Stock?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-Term Traders:</strong> The immediate trend shows positive momentum, but keep a close eye for signs of exhaustion. A neutral stance might be prudent until a clearer signal emerges from the MACD or significant volume changes.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investors:</strong> The long-term uptrend remains valid as long as the price holds above the 200-day SMA (currently at <strong>$17.61</strong>). A pullback to the 50-day SMA (<strong>$13.79</strong>) area could present a safer buying opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>New Buyers:</strong> Avoid chasing the current rally. It's wiser to wait for either a confirmed breakout above <strong>$15.83</strong> with robust volume, or a pullback to the <strong>$11.28</strong> area, which would offer a more favorable risk/reward entry point.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> The technical indicators suggest that the current rally might be losing steam in the short term. While the long-term trend still holds a bullish possibility, a correction seems plausible before the next significant move. Trade cautiously and wait for clear confirmations at these critical technical levels.

<h2>Stock Price Statistics: Volatility and Moving Averages for DJT</h2>
<p>Understanding the statistical behavior of a stock's price is essential for assessing its risk and potential. For DJT, the past year has been a rollercoaster. The stock’s 52-week high reached <strong>$43.46</strong>, while its low was <strong>$10.18</strong>. This wide range highlights significant volatility, likely driven by market sentiment and company-specific news.</p>
<p>Currently, the 50-day moving average stands at <strong>$14.90</strong>, which is below the 200-day moving average of <strong>$19.19</strong>. This configuration is often seen as a bearish signal, suggesting that the short-term trend is weaker than the long-term trend, indicating a potential pullback or consolidation phase. This is particularly relevant for technical traders who rely on these indicators for momentum and trend analysis.</p>
<p>DJT carries a beta of <strong>4.61x</strong>, which is quite high. A beta this elevated implies that the stock tends to move much more dramatically than the broader market—approximately 361% more volatile, to be precise. Coupled with a 30-day annualized volatility of <strong>46.8%</strong>, it's evident that DJT experiences frequent and substantial price swings. For investors, this translates to both higher potential for gains and, crucially, higher downside risk. These indicators are vital for making informed decisions about position sizing and entry timing, especially if you're aiming to balance stability with growth exposure in your portfolio.</p>

<h2>Quarterly Earnings Performance: DJT's Recent Financial Results</h2>

The latest quarter (2025-Q3) saw revenue of <strong>$972.90 thousand</strong>, but a net income of <strong>-$54.81 million</strong>.

However, the year-over-year revenue growth stands at <strong>-3.8%</strong>, indicating a slight contraction when viewed annually.

<h2>Short Selling Information: Analyzing Bearish Sentiment on DJT</h2>
<p>Short selling activity provides a window into how bearish investors are betting against a stock. For DJT, there is currently <strong>14 million</strong> worth of short interest. The short ratio, also known as "days to cover," stands at <strong>2.4x</strong>. This metric estimates how many days it would take for all short positions to be closed, assuming the stock's recent average trading volume. A low short ratio like this suggests that short sellers do not currently hold significant control over DJT's price, and the risk of a prolonged "short squeeze" – a rapid price increase forcing short sellers to buy back shares – is relatively low.</p>
<p>With <strong>8.42%</strong> of the public float sold short, it indicates a moderate level of bearish sentiment, but it’s not an extreme figure. What's interesting is that this level has recently decreased from <strong>15 million</strong> shares shorted, which could suggest a slight shift in bearish sentiment. Despite this, investors should remain aware of potential volatility spikes. Significant news events could still trigger short sellers to cover their positions, leading to rapid price movements. Keeping an eye on these dynamics is key for any investor in DJT.</p>

<h2>Risk Analysis: Understanding DJT's Volatility and Downside Potential</h2>
<p>Every investment comes with risk, and for DJT, the risk profile is notably high. The stock exhibits an annualized volatility of <strong>94.2%</strong>, which is a strong indicator of its potential for large and frequent price swings. For investors, this means both the possibility of significant gains and, equally, considerable downside risk.</p>
<p>The Sharpe ratio, currently at <strong>0.05x</strong>, suggests mixed risk-adjusted returns. A low Sharpe ratio implies that the stock is not generating sufficient return for the amount of risk it takes on. Furthermore, the maximum drawdown of <strong>-89.45%</strong> is a stark reminder of the significant capital loss investors could experience during adverse market conditions. This figure represents the largest percentage drop from a peak to a trough in the stock's history, without new peak being attained.</p>
<p>The Value at Risk (VaR) at a 5% confidence level indicates a potential loss of <strong>-7.55%</strong> in the worst 5% of scenarios. This metric provides a quantitative estimate of the potential loss within a specified timeframe and confidence level. The Sortino ratio of <strong>0.08x</strong>, which focuses specifically on downside risk, offers additional insight into the stock's performance when only negative volatility is considered. While the number is low, it still provides a measure of reward per unit of bad risk.</p>
<p>Given these metrics, investors considering DJT must carefully align these risk factors with their personal risk tolerance and investment objectives. This is clearly not a stock for the faint of heart.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Analysis: Gauging Market Mood for DJT</h2>
<p>Market sentiment can often influence stock prices, sometimes even overriding fundamental data in the short term. For DJT, the current sentiment  a cautiously positive outlook, with a composite sentiment score of <strong>0.41x</strong> and a confidence level of <strong>18.4%</strong>. This positive sentiment is drawn from a combination of data sources, including news coverage, analyst recommendations, and activity in the options market.</p>
<p>Breaking down the components, news analysis shows a Neutral sentiment (<strong>0.08x</strong>), suggesting that recent headlines haven't leaned strongly bullish or bearish. Analyst consensus also points to Neutral. However, options market sentiment reflects a Positive outlook (<strong>0.58x</strong>), indicating that options traders might be positioning for upward movement. The Put/Call Ratio is <strong>0.21x</strong>, which is low and generally suggests bullish sentiment, as fewer puts (bets on decline) are being bought compared to calls (bets on rise).</p>
<p>It's important to remember that while positive, this sentiment signal is relatively weak, especially given the low confidence level. Therefore, it should always be considered alongside a thorough fundamental and technical analysis to form a comprehensive investment perspective. Sentiment can shift rapidly, so ongoing monitoring is advisable.</p>

<h2>Peer Comparison: How DJT Stacks Up Against Industry Rivals</h2>
<p>To truly understand DJT's position, it's helpful to compare it against its peers in the Internet Content &amp; Information space. We're looking at Pinterest (PINS), Snap Inc. (SNAP), and Match Group (MTCH).</p>
<p>DJT, with a market cap of <strong>$3.23 billion</strong>, is the smallest player among this group. Pinterest (PINS) is significantly larger at <strong>$17.76 billion</strong>, followed by Snap (SNAP) at <strong>$13.20 billion</strong>, and Match Group (MTCH) at <strong>$8.02 billion</strong>. This size difference immediately puts DJT in a different league, often implying less market influence and potentially higher growth volatility.</p>
<p>When it comes to revenue growth, DJT's <strong>-3.80%</strong> decline stands in contrast to its peers, with Pinterest showing strong momentum at <strong>16.80%</strong> growth and Snap at <strong>9.80%</strong>. Match Group also saw positive growth at <strong>2.10%</strong>. This highlights a key challenge for DJT in expanding its top line.</p>
<p>Profitability is another stark differentiator. DJT's net margin is not meaningful (as it's recorded as 0.00% in the source report, but the company is losing money). In comparison, Pinterest boasts a healthy <strong>48.99%</strong> net margin, and Match Group has <strong>16.20%</strong>. Snap, while facing losses, has a less severe <strong>-8.60%</strong> net margin. DJT's negative <strong>-9.32%</strong> Return on Equity (ROE) further reflects its current unprofitability, especially when contrasted with Pinterest's impressive <strong>51.49%</strong> ROE.</p>
<p>Regarding debt, DJT's conservative debt-to-equity ratio of <strong>41.85</strong> suggests a relatively strong balance sheet. This compares favorably to Snap's higher leverage at <strong>186</strong>, while Pinterest maintains lower debt levels at <strong>4.25</strong>. Lastly, dividend policies vary: Match Group (<strong>2.28%</strong> yield) rewards shareholders with payouts, whereas DJT, like Pinterest and Snap, is currently reinvesting all cash back into growth initiatives.</p>

<h2>Insider Transactions: What Leadership is Doing with DJT Shares</h2>
<p>Insider activity can sometimes provide a signal about a company's future prospects, as those closest to the business have the most intimate knowledge. Over the last three months, DJT has seen <strong>6 insider transactions</strong>. It's important to analyze the nature of these transactions.</p>
<p>The majority of these (4 out of 6) were stock awards or tax-related dispositions. These are often routine equity compensation activities and typically don't carry a strong directional signal about the company's prospects. For instance, an "F" filing usually denotes shares withheld for tax purposes upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs).</p>
<p>However, there was one notable purchase. Scott Glabe bought <strong>1,000 shares</strong> at <strong>$10.46</strong> on November 18, 2025. This discretionary purchase could be seen as a vote of confidence. Conversely, there were 5 sell transactions, mostly tax-related, but one direct sale by Eric Swider of <strong>5,200 shares</strong> at <strong>$10.59</strong> on November 17, 2025. While the aggregate picture is mixed, the predominance of award-related activities means we shouldn't read too much into these transactions as strong signals for the stock's future direction.</p>

<h2>Risk Factors: Key Considerations for DJT Investors</h2>
<p>Investing in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (DJT) involves a range of risks that every potential investor should carefully consider. While this list isn't exhaustive, it highlights some of the most prominent factors identified through our analysis and general market considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>⚠️ <strong>Overall technical sentiment is Strong Bearish</strong>, suggesting a prevailing cautious or negative outlook among market participants, which could lead to further price declines.</li>
<li>⚠️ The current price of <strong>$11.54</strong> is below the 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of <strong>$13.79</strong>, indicating potential short-term weakness and a lack of immediate buying pressure.</li>
