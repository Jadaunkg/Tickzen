"""
Shared Decorators for TickZen Application
=========================================

This module provides a way to import login_required and admin_required
decorators. The actual decorators are defined in main_portal_app.py
and will be imported from there to maintain compatibility.

For blueprints, import these from main_portal_app after the app is initialized.
"""

# Note: The decorators are defined in main_portal_app.py
# Blueprints should import login_required from main_portal_app
# This module serves as documentation and may be used for future refactoring
